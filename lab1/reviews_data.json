        "text": "Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course.

        "text": "None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite prison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for 50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film.",

SHAWSHANK often shows up as the \"best film of all time\" on various movie lists - including here on the IMDb - and, whilst I don't necessarily agree about that, it is a very good film indeed, near flawless in fact.Every technical element of the film is spot-on, from direction to music, editing, and acting; Morgan Freeman delivers his best ever performance whilst Tim Robbins shows us what a great character actor he is. Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect. Emotion, thrills, drama, and the triumph of the human spirit are all present in this movie, which is one of the greatest prison flicks ever.",

        "text": "Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)**** (out of 4)An innocent man (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison on murder charges and once there he bonds with another man (Morgan Freeman) serving a life sentence. I remember seeing this when it was first released to theaters and walking out thinking it was a masterpiece but apparently others couldn't be bothered to see it since the box office results were very low and it was out of theaters in no time. Over the years the reputation of this film has grown and as I write this it's currently #1 at IMDb. I certainly wouldn't call this the greatest film ever made but it's certainly one of them. I think it's an insult to call this a prison movie because it's so much more than that. This is a film about friendship and hope. Those are two things that have played major parts in many movies but I can't think of too many films where the payoff is as large. What makes the film work so well is that director Durabont takes his time telling a story that takes place over twenty years. Another wonderful thing the director does is that he really makes the twenty years pass on a believable manor. Most films that jump time feel cheap and rushed but that's not the case here because the wonderful screenplay lets us get to know the two main character but also the supporting characters are very well written. What really brings this magic to life are the performances, which are downright brilliant and I'd argue that you can see some of the greatest ensemble acting right in this film. Robbins and Freeman are terrific together and really make for one of the most memorable friendships in movie history. The way Robbins walks and talks is perfectly done and I just love the way, as Freeman says in his narration, he walks around as if he didn't have a care in the world. Freeman gives another wonderful performance but what's really great about him is the narration he adds as he tells us the story. James Whitmore is terrific as the elderly convict and Clancy Brown and Bob Gunton make for excellent villains. I won't spoil the ending for anyone but the final twenty-minutes are at times breathtaking in their beauty and it's message of hope rings louder than most movies.",

He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.",

        "text": "Andy Defresne is a young banker who goes to pieces when he learns his wife is being unfaithful.  He gets drunk and wakes in his car, where he is picked up for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Despite his pleas of innocence, Andy is sentenced to life in prison where he is immediately introduced to the horrors of live inside.  Fellow lifer, Red, tells Andy's story of how he held hope and managed to use his banking skills to improve the conditions for himself and others.I saw this film in the cinema when it came out and, looking back, it is surprising how little fuss was made over it at the time - I was one of 15 or 20 people in the cinema when I saw it (on it's second week out!).  However time has brought it to the top of many popular lists of films and it is mainly due to a story that is based around friendship and hope that engages and eventually uplifts.If you are going to adapt a Stephen King book, the lesson from this film and others appears to be to adapt a short one.  Here the story is set up well with all the usual stuff that we expect from prison dramas, but with the key difference that these events are not the film - no the film is about Andy and Red's friendship.  These two men are great characters and I was very easily drawn into their story.  It is witty, dark and yet enjoyable all at the same time.  It is impossible not to be affected by the ending and this simple uplifting sentiment is part of the reason it has been taken in by so many viewers as one of their favourites.Of course it is a little long at times and for my personal tastes it is a little too sentimental at times although this is to be expected with any Hollywood film.  The slightly sentimental view of the prison also goes so far to ignore the idea that there would be any homosexual relationship that aren't rape and even ruling out any suggestion of racism - there is no tension or segregation in evidence here.  I won't do spoilers but the ending was too clear for me where leaving us with more questions would have been more in holding with the idea of hope that the film had traded in prior to this.  The characters work well due to some great performances.  Robbins is great as Andy and he ages and grows well - whether or not he is believable in his calm approach to the punishment he takes is another matter, but I was caught up in the film enough to get past that.  Freeman may not be the Irish guy from the book (hence the name Red) but he is excellent as the father figure - even if he appears to age very slowly in comparison to Andy.  The chemistry between the two is the key and it really works.Of course having a support cast that includes a great number of fine support actors probably helped.  People like Gunton, Sadler, Bellows and others may not always be great but here they fit the bill. Yes the characters tend to be very clichéd (the bird man, the rapists etc) but again that comes with the genre and I was able to get past these by focusing on the main relationship.  The surprise performance for me was from Clancy Brown - not the most subtle of actors (Highlander is his other famous role) but he is very good here indeed, albeit with little actual character depth.  As director Darabont has done very well, framing some great shots (that crane shot as the bus arrives for the first time) as well as a shot that has become almost iconic.  He is helped by a score that fits the sweeping sense of hope that the film brings.Overall this is an imperfect film and it is flattered by it regular high appearance on the popular `best film' lists.  However it is also a great little story that twists and turns as it is told, it has all the clichés of the genre but at it's heart it is based on friendship and a sense of hope that it is hard not to find uplifting.  For all it's faults it is a popular and moving story that seems to do the trick for the majority of those that see it.",

        "text": "Well I guess I'm a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, \"The Godfather\" was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like \"On The Waterfront\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new prisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967's \"Cool Hand Luke\", but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's masterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.",

The captain of the corrections officers, the massive-jawed Clancy Brown, is quick with his baton, agitato, so to speak. The warden, Bob Gunton, is a corrupt dictator. Morgan Freeman, serving a life sentence, becomes a friend of Robbins. Robbins has a lot in the upper story and goes about doing good for the penitentiary and for the inmates, despite the beatings, attempted rapes, and unjust punishment. Under his management the library becomes a beacon for all prison libraries. Many brutal years pass before Robbins, an amateur geologist, tunnels through the prison wall, hauling a bundle of ill-gotten pelf, crawls into a five-hundred yard long sewer pipe filled with excreta, and splashes through a river to freedom and a tiny coastal village in Mexico, Zijuataneco. I drove there about the time this escape takes place and it really WAS a cheap, peaceful, fishing town with an irregular water supply. Now it's a metropolis. After forty years of imprisonment, Freeman is finally paroled. He joins his friend Robbins in Mexico, where they pursue an honest living as simple fishermen and become lovers for life. (Kidding.) It's a long movie but a gripping one. Movies about prisons are difficult to make. The surroundings are hardly epic, the wardrobe drab, the inmates participate in what the sociologist Erving Goffman called \"the small rewards\" system common to all total institutions -- gifts and trades of items like cigarettes and harmonicas. The inmates have humble jobs, nothing exciting about working in a laundry. No women. Threats and occasional fist fights but no open warfare. And here there's not even the suspense of watching men prepare for an escape. How do you fold these conditions together and come up with a story? The people who produced \"The Shawshank Redemption\" have managed to pull it off, and without directorial display -- no fireworks, no instant cutting, no screechy metallic noise on the sound track, no razzle dazzle whatever, just classic movie making. The success of the film is helped ENORMOUSLY by Morgan Freeman's performance as the friend of Robbins. He's an exceptional actor, and though we may see him now mostly in the role of mentor, his early performances as a heavy shouldn't be ignored. God, he was one charming and terrifying pimp in \"Street Smart.\" Robbins does a good job too, although his role requires him to be subdued. It also requires him to be saintly, alas. There's nothing wrong with him. He's a genius, doing everybody's tax returns. He's more sinned against than sinning. Cool Hand Luke at least was reckless and expedient and brought the storm down upon himself. And Luke's guards would have made mincemeat out of Robbins. Robbins' prison is a kind of fantasy land in which he can at will commandeer an office, lock the doors, and play a record of an opera over all the loudspeakers. It's also a pipe dream to believe that all of the inmates would stop what they're doing and stare in wonder at the loudspeakers broadcasting two ladies singing in Italian. Slim Whitman, maybe. But Joan Sutherland? They would have booed. Nor would inmates show the kind of solidarity on display here, once Robbins pulls them together. The coolest presentation of self in an institution like this is utter indifference, except for some offense against the honor of one's self or one's gang. It's a cold-hearted place in which practically nobody applauds when someone else succeeds.However, put all the fantasy aside and accept it for what it is, a fictional tale of men who pay dearly for misdeeds and ultimately save themselves and undermine the foundation of corrupt society. Not heroically, just by sheer persistence.",

He is sent to Shawshank Prison where he tells his fellow inmates he is innocent but as fellow inmate 'Red' says; everybody in Shawshank is innocent. Red has already served ten years and is the guy to see if you want something smuggled into the prison. Andy asks for two things; a small rock hammer and Rita Hayworth! Soon after Red provides him with one rock hammer and a large poster featuring Rita Hayworth. Life in Shawshank is not easy; the guards are brutal and some of the inmates are worse. Andy survives though and things get better when he is able to help the meanest of the guards avoid paying tax on an inheritance; soon he is acting as accountant to the whole prison and helping the corrupt warden squirrel away large sums of money earned by prison labour. He is able to use this position to improve the life of prisoners too; a few beers for a work party, improvements to the prison library and education for some inmates. All the time Andy professes his innocence then one day after he has spent almost twenty years behind bars a young man comes to Shawshank; the man tells the story of how a cellmate at a previous prison claimed to have murdered a man and the woman he was with leaving her banker husband to take the blame. Andy believes this may finally get him out of prison but there is no way the warden will let him go; he is too useful and he knows too much that won't stop Andy though.This film, based on a Stephen King short story, is rightfully considered a classic. There are no scenes that felt unnecessary from start to finish the story moves at a good pace. We see both the good and the bad inside the prison; there are scenes of brutality but also scenes of joy such as watching the prisoners enjoy the simple pleasure of having a cold beer of a scorching day it is details like this that make the film special. There is also the joy of seeing that Andy will not break and his greatest triumph coming just as it looks as if he has finally reached breaking point. The cast does a great job; Tim Robbins is great as Andy and the always reliable Morgan Freeman is on top form as Red; theirs is one of the great portrayals of a screen friendship. It isn't just the likable characters who are well acted though; Bob Gunton is subtly unpleasant as the hypocritical Warden; quoting scripture one minute profiteering, and much worse, the next; Clancy Brown is also great as the truly unpleasant Captain Hadley; the senior guard who brutalises the inmates. After the suffering inside the finale chapter where we see Andy's escape and revenge makes this a feel-good movie despite what we've seen before. This is definitely a must see film.",

As two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding peace and redemption through acts of common help , friendship and decency . But when the proof of Andy's innocence is ripped away by those who need his services ,we learn that all is not quite what it seems at this State Penitentary , provoking a few susprises in the last two reels .\nThis is a very good and serious prison movie with thrills , emotion , exciting scenes , colour-blind relationships , hardnut camaraderie , gang opression , and violent disavowal of any homosexual implications . Prison buffs will find a lot of incidents to relish and the great spiritual resolution takes some swallowing and unexpected surprises . Adapted from the novella ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption¨ ; the twist here is the upright starring is exceptionally bright , as his ability with accountancy leads to his handling the finances of everyone , from the humblest guard to the prison boss . Wonderful spectacle in watching time-passer while changing the bombshell actresses of the history : Rita Hayworth , Marilyn Monroe , Raquel Welch . US prison films have been making solid fares for more than sixty years and apart from slowness of pace in the second half , this one is well up to prison standards . This Frank Darabont's theatrical debut turns out to be a throwback rendition to the kind of literate , thought-provoking prison drama Hollywood used to make , such as : I am a fugitive from a chain gang , Birdman of Alcatraz and Escape from Alcatraz .Tim Robbins plays magnificently Andy , an inmate finding solace and eventual redemption , Tim provides his usual talent for playing ambiguous roles , as his notable skills are put to good use. Along with Robbins' best screen acting there are various Oscar-worthy supporting characters with special mention for Morgan Freeman as the good fixer who brings his ordinary grace to what could have been a thankless role , the veteran James Withmore as the crow-keeping librarian , the sympathetic newcomer inmate Gil Bellows ,William Sadler , Mark Rolston and the ruthless guardian Clancy Brown and , of course , the egoistic and nasty governor excellently played by Bob Gunton .It contains a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins . And an enjoyable and really feeling musical score by Thomas Newman . In his engrossing direction debut ,Darabont avoids boring by fleeing most prison movie cliches . It results to be a pleasure of discovering a first-time filmmaker with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience , giving sensitive scenes , and brave enough to let roles details accumulate without recourse the excessively maudlin and over-sentimentality. It is a true masterpiece , being marvelously acted and perfectly paced.",

Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but engrossing and satisfying, \"Shawshank\" was not a big hit at the box-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from ****",

Many analyses missed the mark. Following is the real reason it is ranked so high, and why it will never sink much, if any. And I hope it never does.This film deals with several \"hot\" buttons in us. A cheating spouse. A husband wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Corrupt law enforcement. A prison where inmates get maimed or killed. A smart inmate who plots a brilliant escape. The corrupt warden getting his just reward. Two friends being re-united with a good life ahead of them. Combined with a good script and good cinematography. What's not to like about this story?I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time I get something new out of it that I either didn't see before, or had not made a mental connection to. I recently (year 2014) upgraded my personal copy from DVD to Blu-Ray and both the picture and sound are better. This film continues to spark the occasional argument of whether it really should be rated on IMDb as the top film of all time. I don't know exactly where \"Shawshank Redemption\" should rank on the all-time list. That is akin to comparing home run hitters or golfers from different centuries. The games are quite different, as is true in cinema. I gave this film a \"10\", and on my list it is in one of the best movies of all time, along with a number of others. At the same time, I recognize that everyone else has a different opinion. I don't really see any value in trying to decide a rank order for all time. Each film should be appreciated for what it has to offer, no more, and no less.",

The film shows what prison life is all about.

James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society.

This was my question.The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts.",

        "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",

The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s scoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters",

Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.",

It was about losses and gains, hope and despondence, injustice and rectitude, and definitely about friendship. Prison just happened to be the backdrop of this film but it could have easily been anyplace. The prison setting played a critical role and was interwoven into the overall story but it wasn't the story. The story was so much more and the movie did so well in pulling you in and making you care. You couldn't help but loathe the warden and his right-hand-man. You couldn't help but like Andy and Red. You couldn't help but want the happy ending.Absolutely, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece.

I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling \"for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!\" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing.

        "text": "It's not a complex tale, but it is a tale done well that is inspirational in spite of the bleak environment.I am continually fascinated by the complexity of Andy Dufresne. (Presumably) the only innocent man in Shawshank, it is nevertheless Andy who seems to best incapsulate the guilt of his actions. Did he kill his wife? No. But I always feel as though he blames himself for her cheating, blames himself for wanting to kill her, and seems to accept his fate more than most men might.The friendship of Red and Andy is regularly regarded as one of the high points of this film, and it has always resonated with me. The innocent man (Andy) breaks all sorts of laws and plans an elaborate prison break. The guilty man (Red) pays for his crimes and is eventually released on good behavior. Both end up together on a beach in Mexico, to live out the rest of their lives in solitude, apart from society. That's always felt like the tragedy of Shawshank; criminal or not, everyone ends up the same broken man by the end.The brief moments of freedom in this film shine like nothing else, for me. The beer break on the roof, the opera played over the PA, and finally the broken boat on the shores of the Pacific: each of these moments is engineered by Andy to get a taste, a glimpse of freedom. Things that he had taken for granted before Shawshank. That scene where the men drink the beer on the roof looks like the tastiest beer I could ever imagine, almost completely because of the dark tone of the film up until that point.",

        "text": "I'm utterly mystified at the cult of idolatry that has developed around this solid but not overly memorable prison film based on a Stephen King short story.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" came out of nowhere in 1994 to be nominated for 7 Academy Awards, and I have to believe that it's the film's underdog story that has helped it to develop such a following over the years as much as it is the quality of the film itself. There's nothing egregiously wrong with it, but it's overly-sentimental and obvious film-making from a director who has done nothing but make too serious film adaptations of Stephen King novels. I think it's become apparent over the years that Morgan Freeman is a one-trick pony when it comes to acting, but at the time he wasn't quite as well known, so the wise sage role he plays here seemed good enough to get him an Oscar nomination. However, it's Tim Robbins who really deserves the most praise as the man wrongly imprisoned. The less said about the actors who play the various prison personnel, the better -- they're all played as horrorshow goons.The original Stephen King story was an entertaining bit of pulp, but Frank Darabont tries to turn it into something that the story just isn't -- namely, an epic story about one man's struggle to free his soul. As a result, where the story felt sleek and satisfying, the film feels sanctimonious and bloated.Grade: B",

The narrative is always engrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed without exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out as they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something special. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification, part of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red was always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it without seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the direction.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's guilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and others) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the three quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then the story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end.This is, without any doubt, one of the most spiritually uplifting films I have ever seen.",

        "text": "Almost as interesting as this tale of men behind bars is the enduring popularity it has enjoyed since being released on video following its poor box office. The reason is fairly clear to see: for all its dark setting, the film is about hope and how hope can set you free. We all have hope, and we all feel imprisoned – whether it's by a dead-end job, a loveless relationship, an out-of-shape body – and it's only the hope that things will somehow improve (even if, unlike Andy Dufresne, we do precious little to help things along) that keeps us going. The Shawshank Redemption validates this blind, irrational hope while simultaneously reinforcing it. This is the film's strength, and it uses it to good advantage. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make believable if unlikely friends – at the beginning of their friendship one lacks hope of any kind while the other is unable to express his feelings, a flaw he later realises is indirectly the reason he finds himself behind bars. By the end of the film both have changed – and both are released.The film makes use of every genre cliché you can think of: the sadistic guard, the corrupt warden – fifty years ago, Hollywood wardens were mostly beneficial characters, but they seem to have lost their way lately – the bull queers, the fish out of water with no chance of survival, etc, and although this isn't necessarily a weakness, it's familiarity means the overlong running time drags on occasion as we're faced with all too familiar situations. And while there are malevolent prisoners present in the form of the bull queers who wander around looking for 'fresh fish' and vulnerable inmates to rape, all other prisoners are a kind of homogeneous mass, a decent enough bunch with few unique characteristics and no malice or resentment towards a society that has effectively discarded them.The irony of the film is that the good guys are the ones behind bars – as Dufresne wryly comments, he had to come to prison to become a criminal – while those ostensibly representing justice and law are violent braggarts and bible-bashing hypocrites. Their come-uppance, when it finally arrives, is wholly deserved, and there are few films that engineer a turning of the tables as wholly complete as the one engineered here by Dufresne – another reason for its phenomenal popularity: we all know, or have known, someone like the warden (although perhaps not as extreme), smug and self-serving, who deserves their come-uppance.Darabont wanted the film to end with Red giving his little 'I hope' bit while the bus he's travelling on disappears over the horizon, and it's a shame the studio didn't let him have his way. That ending on the beach looks exactly like what it is – a tacked on ending to keep the men in suits happy. Andy Dufresne, with his uncompromising sense of purpose, would surely have held firm under their pressure",

The Plot:After the police in Maine find the bodies of a married woman and her lover,who were shot eight times.They bring in the married woman's husband.A hot-shot banker Andy Dufren(Tim\"The Mystic River\" Robbins) .Who clams that he is not guilty.At the end of the case,Andy is found guilty and given two life sentences at Shawshank prison Maine.When he is first there he is very closed off from everyone.And has fights with a prison group called \"The Sisters\".Until he tells a guard how to keep money from a will.While in there,he gets the trust of the guards and the warden and builds a strong friendship with a black marketeer named Red(played fantastically by Morgan\"The Dreamcatcher,The Se7ven\"Freeman).Things are going well,till an inmate Tommy,tells Andy,that in a prison he was in,he met the man who did the murder Andys in Shawshank for.The warden,who thinks Tommy is to much of a risk for his money business due to Andy doing all work for him),so he kills Tommy.After this,Andy decides its time he gets out of Shawshank.View on the film:The cast. This is one of the rare films,where all the cast just click into there roles.The two leads Robbins and Freeman,who give some of there best work in this film.The way they work and build there friendship in the film,that is sadly rarely seen in any movies.The supporting characters in the film do a really good job at standing out and not feeling like they are just card-board cut outs.The main one in the supporting cast that stand out is James Whitmore as Brooks.who makes a very enjoyable characters,who you feel very sad,to see go out in a very sad way.The Screenply/Direction.Wirter/director Frank\"The Green Mile\" Darabont (who made a student-film based on a King short story:The Woman in the Red Room),does a screenplay that easily improves on the short story.While Kings short story spent (i feel) a bit to much time on the exposition in his story,while Darabont makes sure to keep the set-up going at a good pace,and to tighten some of the story lines(Brooks was hardly in the short story,Tommy was not killed).But he makes sure to keep the feel of the story so they do not feel as strange add-ons to the story.The direction the Darabont does is to make sure to see the actors work build in the scenes,while doing a good job at keeping the film going at a pace that does not feel over-long (something that is rare with movies now).

Tim Robbins plays banker Andy Dufresne in 1947, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. The verdict is not the issue, but rather his familiarizing himself into routine life within prison walls. He faces the trials of violent leering inmates but forms a bond with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. Redding can get things for a price and soon Andy has items smuggled into his cell. Andy finds favor when his banking comes into play and doing taxes for the corrupt Christian warden and the guards. Andy is able to improve the library but discovers a scheme by the warden that leaves him to his own devices when proof of his innocence is sabotaged. Director Frank Darabont paints the grim and depressing portrait of prison and populates it with personalities struggling to exist within. Robbins is at his best as a victim adapting and improving his circumstance before intelligence wins out. Freeman is great as the humble and resourceful Redding. James Whitmore plays aged librarian Brooks whose release leads to questions regarding freedom verses existence. Bob Gunton is effective as the ruthless warden. Redemption is freedom of mind and soul whether in prison or in opportunity. Score: 10 / 10",

It also has its bad points that being the evil prison system with its mean warden and guards who batter the prisoners. Still, I can role with that as I can the fact that Tim Robbins is horribly cast in this film. When he first arrives at Shawshank he does the role perfectly, however his performance never changes throughout the movie. He still talks softly, still has the same look, the guy has supposedly spent some time here so he is going to change even if he does not lose his hope. There are many positives too though as Morgan Freeman literally carries the film and I loved the ending escape scenes. I also like the fact I can just start watching this movie in the middle and just go on doing something else. Maybe pick it up again later at the beginning, it is just one of those movies that I can watch it from here or there and be entertained, but do not necessarily feel I have to watch it from beginning to end. I know I am now going to be attacked though as I did not give this movie a nine or ten though. Especially attacking a movie that so many people think is the greatest thing ever, however this is just an opinion so just chill.

        "text": "It shouldn't be lost on anyone that well into the 21st century, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has been the No. 1 film, or close to the top for years among movie viewers who have rated movies on IMDb. With more than 2.4 million ratings just on this film alone, it's probably safe to say that it would stay close to its top spot in any public survey.What a great film the Shawshank Redemption is. Even though thousands have written reviews already, a little should yet be said about great films that don't win the awards or become big box office hits, but become highly popular mostly for their story. That usually is a matter of justice, within the story itself, and for the film having been made. And, justice is the undergirding theme of this film.For anyone who hasn't seen the film, the conclusion is a real surprise. And it brings to closure all of the angst and apprehension and concern one has about the wrong treatment of the hero, Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins. The narrative format adds to a sense of the drama and reality of a story as told by Red Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. One wants so badly to see an innocent man exonerated of the crime for which he was convicted. While the circumstances of the plot make that impossible, the alternative ending serves justice to the hilt. Because, in this way, justice is served on those who abused their power. The warden and guard commander couldn't be convicted for that, but in their evil ways they were open to other law violations for which they could be taken downSo, the ending satisfies justice and the hearts of so many viewers. It is reminiscent of a true story of a true gangster. The big-time gangster of the prohibition era, Al Capone, could never be caught and prosecuted for so many crimes he committed, including murder. But the federal government was finally able to convict him for income tax evasion which led to his imprisonment.Here's a film that didn't even cover its costs at the box office when first released, and took a re-release to earn a modest sum. Yet it remains a favorite, far above many films that have won multiple academy awards over the years. While the cast all are very good, and the production qualities first rate, it's the story - the plot with a superb screenplay that makes this a great film.",

        "text": "The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (\"Shawshank\" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called \"The Sisters\". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the \"Sisters\" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of \"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\", \"Cool Hand Luke\", \"Brubaker\" and the more recent \"The Last Castle\". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, \"The Green Mile\", based, like \"The Shawshank Redemption\" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word \"prison\", from the French \"pris\" (\"taken\"), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as \"penitentiary\" or \"reformatory\" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the \"fixer\" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted \"The Godfather\" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. \"Shawshank\" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his \"rickshaw\" film was going) and \"redemption\", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word \"redemption\" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10",

        "text": "\"Prison is no fairy tale world.\" Red Redding (Morgan Freeman)This quote is partly true in the context of the super-popular melodrama (based on a Stephen King short story), The Shawshank Redemption. As the opening 1947 scenes in Shawshank Prison in author King's Maine (actually filmed in Mansfield, Ohio), the hero, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is raped multiple times by the \"Sisters.\" That's to be expected from what prison lore offers over the years in movies and reality.After Andy gets through these humiliations, and Morgan Freeman intones writer-director Frank Darabont fine script about life inside and out, the story turns almost into a fairy tale: Former bank vice president Andy brings his business skills to high and low: warden, guards, and prisoners.

It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather: Part II\", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.",

        "text": "There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox",

        "text": "My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an \"offer he can't refuse\", or \"Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes\" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played.",

        "text": "THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.",

        "text": "The Godfather (1972) **** (out of 4) Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece adapted from Mario Puzo's novel about crime lord Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his attempt to keep his family from going in the wrong direction. Everything imaginable has already been said about this movie so there's not too many reasons to go back through it. Having recently watched the movie theatrical as part of Paramount's re-release, I must say that knowing the film and story so closely allowed me to just sit back and enjoy what Coppola put on the screen. What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly. People know about the studio not wanting Brando and Al Pacino but can you imagine what would have happened had neither one been here? I've never felt this was anywhere near Brando's greatest performance and in fact I might not even place it in the top ten. That's not saying anything against his work here but it speaks for how great he was. I think the most impressive thing was seeing how well he could play someone elderly. Just think that he followed this up with LAST TANGO IN Paris and it just shows what all he could do. With Pacino it has been said that the studio didn't like the rushes they were seeing involving some of his early stuff like at the wedding. Watching these scenes it's easy to see why they'd be nervous but just check out the sequence when his character takes on the responsibility of going to the restaurant. It's really like Pacino the legend is born in this scene and that brilliant scene is like us seeing what was to follow in his career. Not only is there Brando and Pacino but also Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale and Abe Vigoda turning in masterful performances. Another thing that really sticks out is how brave Coppola was for letting the story takes its time. There are many, many slow moments here where we get dialogue scenes that get dragged out. Everyone mentions the wedding sequence but this is a perfect example of where the slowness is such a benefit as it really gets you on the inside of understanding how this family works. Coppola allowing the film to takes its time was a dangerous move but it really pays off because there's not another film like this. A lot of future movies tried to copy the style and this certainly slow, building drama but none of them were as successful. Nino Rota's music is simply irresistible and the opening cords as the movie opens are just chilling. The cinematography is some of the most amazing you're ever going to see and the lighting here is among the greatest ever. Especially effective are the scenes inside the Don's office and how the light was used. THE GODFATHER isn't going to get my vote as the greatest movie of all time, of the decade or even the greatest gangster picture. With that said, there's no question that this is still a essential part of American film history and with so much talent involved it's just amazing to watch it today and admire what all they were able to accomplish.",

Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business.

Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality.

It takes an outstanding book and cranks it up a notch. It's hard for me to comment because, as a rule, I don't like movies about organized crime. First, I fear the reality of it. It holds a power in this country that we must always be aware of. It is in so much of our world, more than we realize. I feel at times that glamorizing these individuals is destructive. Nevertheless, I have to put that aside because this is the subject matter and at no time has anyone so masterfully put on screen the portrayal of these thugs, who see themselves as family as Coppola. I got the shivers walking out of the movie. Unlike horror movies where it's over and done with (with the exception of \"Deliverance\" which I will never get out of my mind), this haunts one for days after. I watched this again a few weeks ago, and what we have is a milieu that separates itself from out mundane existences. These people choose to live in a violent world of their own choosing. One issue that always gets me is, how do they enjoy the fruits of their \"labor\"? It seems that a hell on earth is created for them. The unfortunate thing is that they push that hell onto their victims in the name of family.",

        "text": "\"The Godfather\" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1972, so this one is already almost 50 years old now, 3 to go, and it runs for almost three hours. I am not even sure if it is necessary to talk about the basics here, but lets go. The director is Francis Ford Coppola and he is also part of the writing team. This is probably still the defining mafia movie and the rating here on imdb says it all. It won Best Picture at the Oscars and Marlon Brando (in heavy makeup) received the second Oscar of his career. Add to that a writing Oscar, but the movie was cut short because of the tremendous success of Cabaret at the Oscars this year where Fosse won Director over Coppola and Grey beat all the three supporting nominees from The Godfather. I don't think Pacino was in the right category though, but I guess they really were all over Brando and wanted to make sure that nobody (from his own film) could stop him from winning. Anyway, the film starts with Brando and he is certainly defining in the first 90 minutes of the movie until an assassination attempt happens and from that moment on he moves a bit into the background and the boys take over, most of all Pacino for whom it was really a star-making performance.Now as for the plot, it is a cleanly structured film really. There is basically one affair after the next and many of these issues don't have to do a lot with the next. The movie starts at the godfather's daughter's wedding and there is not really too much focus on the actual wedding process, but instead we are taken into the world of crime right away when an old acquaintance asks a lethal favor from Don Corleone. Pretty memorable beginning really that has been spoofed in many other movies, even animated ones not too long ago. Not much later, there is of course the really famous longer sequence that results in a bloody horse head between the sheets. And they get longer and longer as next up is the key plot that involves the Turk turning into the main antagonist as he plans to kill the godfather, takes out his most brutal assistant at the same time and abducts his lawyer. And while the latter is also considered a son (not by blood), we also witness how the godfather's offspring deals with this situation in their own very unique ways: Sonny the hothead, Fredo the weakling who cannot protect his father whatsoever, Tom Hagen (the reasonable one) and eventually Mike whose role is not too clear early and who is far far away from becoming the man he turns out to be at the end of the movie. There is still more focus for him on his love relationship to his significant other and he says he is not like his family. But the attack on his father and later on the killing of one of his brothers really change everything and we find out he is just exactly like his dad. As for Hagen, I still think Duvall is really good in this movie and there is one very brief moment in this film when we hear Vito Corleone say something like somebody who is not Italian like them, which shows that Hagen is really accepted as a son and also seen as Italian pretty much, even if he is German/Irish. This would be one of the really rare funny moments, slightly funny I guess, this film has to offer. It is never about making the audience laugh admittedly, but more to witness the demise of the old man and the rise of the new star eventually and the crime and brutal murders that come with it. As for Michael, this of course also includes him losing his wife when he is in Italy. Had that murder not occurred maybe he never would have returned and the story could have taken a completely different path.I think one of this film's biggest strengths is that despite the really big quantity of characters, even for a 3-hour movie, they are all fairly memorable with their quirks, mannerisms and backgrounds. Take McCluskey for example. The movie could have done completely without him and he is really only there to serve as support for the Turk, but still he is truly memorable. Actually, his little words on how he frisked hundreds of guys like Mike for guns is another somewhat funny moment. He has no idea what's coming his way. I also want to say a few words on Fredo. He is not as big as the others in here yet or actually he is not too far away either. His scenes are all memorable and he is really definition of weakness and incompetence in 1970s cinema. Of course, that is even more the case in the sequel where he plays an absolute key character. But in this one here, he is also vital really and you could write pages alone on his character and how he (re)acts. Truly sad really Cazale died so early, but he left us a truly remarkable character and honestly every film he made was a winner basically. Now another thing to add here is that it also the small moments that count. When Mike lies to Kay at the very end, we find out 100% where his priorities are now and that he won't let anything get in the way of keeping his father's empire intact.Another strength here is that Puzo and Coppola are not scared of killing off major characters and it works oh so well because it makes a whole lot of sense. Pay attention to the permanent contrast of new/young life vs. death towards the end: When Vito dies, there is nobody around him except his very young grandson and that still puts major focus on the family component that is oh so crucial here, also when Mike talks about somebody treating Fredo badly. Or the christening of course, which is the best example with the baby and the alleged goodness vs. all the killings that take place at the same time. Vito was gone and that point already and he had gotten soft anyway, but Mike is not scared one bit about blood on his hands to defend his family's honor. Overall, this is a tremendous movie and when we see the bodyguard guy close the door eventually between Mike and Kay, it is all clear. Mike has turned into his dad by then. And how things go on, you can watch in the second film that in my opinion (thanks to Bobby) is even better than the first, even if the majority does not disagree.But yeah as for this one here, it was the third time I watched it I think and it gets better with each viewing I suppose. It is a film you don't wanna miss out on. Highly recommended, really close call between Cabaret and this one for me when it comes to 1972's finest. I'd still go with Cabaret though I think. It is just as much of a masterpiece. And finally, also pay attention to all the minor references included in here that seem even more interesting if you know how the saga continues. This is also why it is so much worth rewatching. One example would be Vito swearing on his grandchildren's well-being. There's many more. Do not miss out and girls who read this don't trust people saying this is a film that will only or mostly appeal to males. If you like quality filmmaking, then there is no way you should not watch! Oh yeah, but obviously you need to be able to stomach the violence. Just one example, there's a guy shot in the eye through his glasses and we see the blood pouring from his head and that is far from the most violent stuff depicted in here. That's all, folks. Watch it, don't be scared by the running time. You will not ask yourself afterwards if this was really worth 3 hours of your time, but if you are ready immediately for another 3 hours, namely the sequel. I was lucky enough to watch this film on the big screen and I am already looking forward to an occasion to see the second (and third). Certainly pick this opportunity over a small television or laptop screen. If necessary, wait for the 50th anniversary when it certainly will be shown again in many theaters.

Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.",

However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs.  Michael's involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low.  When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war.The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the best films ever made.  The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it deals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. The basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time.  It creates many memorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge that we all share  that's why it's referred to in everything from Sopranos down to The Simpsons.Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. From the opening speech with it's memorable lines and camera focus down to the final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout.  The action is a pleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent attempts at gangster films.Pacino is great  he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but he manages it into the next film too.  Brando is always a risk on any film, and when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool, Coppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a performance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at some time.  The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all stages.  Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more ageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano etc.In every area the film oozes class and professionalism.  The look at family life is excellent and the only downside is that it can't help but glamorise organised crime  people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. But then, if we're going to start criticising films because they glamorise violence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list  long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer blockbusters.Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are  but Godfather has been on most people's top 5 list for decades and will to continue to be for many more.  Now that's respect.",

But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the \"family\" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)",

        "text": "Lately it seems, \"The Godfather\" has had a ubiquitous presence on the cable channels; not a week goes by where I don't see it listed playing at one time or another. For some reason I've never considered watching the film from start to finish since the first time I saw it during it's theatrical release back in 1972 - until today. There's a good reason why. I don't think there's ever been another movie to stay with me the way this one has over the past four decades. I remember virtually everything about it, even the minor scenes like the hit on driver Paulie and the 'sleeps with the fishes' calling card regarding Luca Brasi. Also the names - Clemenza, Barzini, Solozzo, Tartaglia; Moe Green too, even though he wasn't Italian. So effective was the magic of the film that I still have to check every now and then to see if Abe Vigoda (Tessio) is still alive (like I did today), only to find out that yes he is, still going strong at nearly ninety! Quite simply, \"The Godfather\" is, with no pun intended, the godfather of all the great gangster films, dating all the way back to 1931's \"Little Caesar\" and \"Public Enemy\". For Marlon Brando, it was the quintessential performance of American cinema, so nuanced and mesmerizing that it's impossible to forget. The movie in fact was so powerful that it literally made overnight stars of it's supporting players - Pacino, Caan and Duvall.There has been enough written about the film that I don't need to get into the story itself. I'll content myself with mentioning the scenes that literally blow me away, then and now - Sonny's job on Carlo in the middle of the neighborhood (that last kick is priceless), the mob hit on Sonny in the causeway, Michael's restaurant rubout of Solozzo and McCluskey, and the way Michael handled Tom Hagen's ouster as consigliere. The cherry topping of course is the baptismal scene, Michael renouncing Satan as he does the devil's work of eliminating the heads of the families who stood in opposition to the Corleones. Every scene of the movie is staged perfectly, yet rendered effortlessly as if it were just another day in the life.It would have been too easy to use the classic tag line in my summary above, you know, the one about making an offer that can't be refused. With \"The Godfather\", it seems that every scene is larger than life, with the total picture being even greater than the sum of it's parts. So I'll content myself with a recommendation that seems apropos by quoting Clemenza after his man whacked Paulie - \"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli\". For cinema fans, \"The Godfather\" is all cannoli.",

        "text": "When people think of \"The Godfather\", they usually think of the Mafia. But, as Entertainment Weekly noted, calling \"The Godfather\" a Mafia movie is like calling \"The Odyssey\" a guide to the Aegean Sea. This story of how the Corleone family rules New York with their own version of justice entails everything that makes movies good.First, the opening scene. The shot of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) sitting in his chair petting his cat sets the Don up as a fatherly - but shady - figure. Then, you see Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding: the Corleones are not just a bunch of evil slime-balls. During the wedding, Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Wearing his military uniform, Michael looks like a handsome young man - possibly an allusion to how these people are adept at deceiving other people. At the wedding, Michael meets WASP-ish outsider Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who's naturally a little weirded out by the whole Mafia lifestyle - at one point, Michael has to tell her: \"That's my family, Kay. That's not me.\" The other two sons are Sonny (James Caan), the immature playboy, and Fredo (John Cazale), the loser. And there's also the adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), now a lawyer. After a trip to Hollywood where he unsuccessfully tries to get a producer to hire singer Johnny Fontane (who apparently was not really based on Frank Sinatra), we all know what Tom does with the horse.A scene that did a really good job showing the break between 1st and 2nd generation Americans is the scene where Michael and Kay are Christmas shopping and \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\" is playing. Vito, as an immigrant, kept many of the traditions from his native country. Michael, born and raised in the US, certainly seems less Italian that his father.Then, of course, Vito gets shot. After Michael gets revenge, he has to hide out in Sicily. While he's there...well, we all know what happens to Sonny. This prompts Vito to negotiate with the other families. But then, Michael turns out to be even more ruthless than his father.Probably the most incredible scene is when Michael presides over the baptism of Connie's child. As soon as Michael \"renounces\" Satan, things get ugly. It basically says that every time that they say something holy, someone gets slaughtered.All in all, Francis Ford Coppola created an inimitable cinematic masterpiece. And the sequel actually managed to equal the original.",

        "text": "The people who vote on the Internet Movie Database have ranked \"The Godfather\" as the greatest film ever in human history. Which is nothing to sneeze at, and deserves some seriously thought. I watched the film, thought it was great, but hardly found it to be the greatest film ever made. I mean, if you told me \"Citizen Kane\" was the greatest film ever made, I would wholeheartedly agree. And personally, as far as gangster movies go -- with or without Al Pacino -- I think the real choice should be \"Scarface\". But I'm not professionally trained as a movie critic, so maybe I'm missing something.I asked my supervisor and a co-worker about the film, and while they both thought the film was good, they really did not think it was some amazing masterpiece. My supervisor said, \"maybe it's good because it is so real\", but that's not a convincing reason and how \"real\" it is I cannot say for sure.If nothing else, the film might be great simply because it has become so cliché. The horse head, the Marlon Brando voice, the gun behind the toilet and the line \"an offer he can't refuse\" are all part of pop culture these days (over 30 years later). But does being cliché make the film great? I guess that would make \"Star Wars\" the greatest film ever made, which is certainly not true (though not a bad film by any means).And sure, you have powerful and memorable performances. James Caan is amazing, Marlon Brando is a bit over-the-top (a mumbling, lock-jawed godfather? sure...). And Al Pacino is of course great as always, maybe more so here than anywhere else. Not only does he have more range here than any other film than \"Scent of a Woman\" (more often than not he simply repeats a variation of his Michael Corleone role), but he is so young and plain that he is not even recognizable as Al Pacino in many scenes (I didn't recognize him until 30 minutes into the picture).I haven't yet mentioned the plot: an aging mafia boss (Marlon Brando) hands control over to his son (Al Pacino) when the father becomes ill, though he hoped never to do so since his son is Ivy League educated. Brando's role is actually quite small compared to the attention he is given (the film is really about Pacino coming of age).The directing is decent. Nothing special, but not awful, either. Very real and almost gritty (but not dark). The acting is great. The music is perfect. The only thing that really needed work was the fact that many of the Italian scenes had no subtitles and were thus lost in (lack of) translation. The entire Sciliy subplot and Appollonia were excellent and could not have been improved upon.I'm sure much more could have been said, but I'll cut myself off here. Certainly looking forward to Part II (though keeping my hopes and expectations low) and maybe someday I'll see Part III (though I've been warned not to).",

        "text": "It's a beautifully made movie. Not just because of the subtle direction by Francis Coppola but because of the production design (Dean Tavoularis) and photography (Gordon Willis). Everything seems to lend itself to the impact of the story, which describes the replacement of Marlon Brando's Mafia chief by his youngest son, Al Pacino. Make up is expertly handled. Pacino's broken cheek is properly swollen and blue and fades gradually, providing the viewer with a kind of cinematic clock telling the passage of time. Nino Rota's score is tops. During the baptism scene, which takes place in a church, the organ hums an apt courtly tune. Then, as the film cross cuts between ritualized religion and ritualized homicide, the organ insensibly becomes darker and more ominous.These departments seldom get enough credit -- except recently in CGI extravaganza's. The more nuanced touches in furnishings, wardrobe, shadows and the like generally go unrewarded by the public. But this film, and a few others like it (\"Shane\", \"Verdict\") wouldn't be what they are if they'd been clumsily handled.Brando has given maybe four nearly perfect performances and this is one of them. To appreciate it we have to skip over all his failed attempts to extend his range, the dancing bookmaker, the comic Oriental sidekick. The Don Corleone we see doesn't radiate power so much as fatigue. Al Pacino is transformed from a smiling lad, happy to be home from the war, to a dispassionate kingpin of crime at the end, a bit too abruptly. Sterling Hayden, as the corrupt Irish cop, has invested this much in a role only once before, in \"Dr. Strangelove.\" Example: After smashing Pacino's face with one blow of his oversized fist, Hayden turns away, winces with self control and pounds his fist into the night-time air.It's hard to imagine how Coppola could have improved on his direction of this tragic tale. With the exception of the violent scenes, of which there are many, maybe too many, the film's texture is smooth and understated. Example: A baker shows up at the hospital just before some would-be assassins arrive and Pacino talks this innocent man into posing as a gunman. Not a word from the baker. He does what he's told. And when it's safe, he tries to light a cigarette but his hands are shaking so badly that Pacino has to light it for him.The women don't have much to do. Diane Keaton as the Shiksa is puzzled but hopeful. Talia Shire as the abused wife is hysterical. Mamma Corleone is a revered background figure who rarely shows up.That's the good stuff -- and it's very good indeed.The bad stuff, I'm not sure about. The Corleone family, like the other five families in New York, are making a fortune. That's evident from their digs, their cars, their raw silk suits. But what business are they in? That's one of the things Keaton is curious about. The businesses are only alluded to twice -- \" the gambling, the liquor, even the women.\" Well, what's so bad about that? Who gives a damn about illegal gambling, smuggled liquor, or escort services? Nobody. Drugs are brought in towards the end, but only dealt with discretely. We never sell it around schools, it must be strictly controlled, and let the darkies up in Harlem have it and \"kill their souls.\" The words \"extortion,\" \"protection racket,\" and \"Mafia\" are never used. This is a pretty rotten business they're in. And if Marlon Brando' Don was a kind of community organizer, Al Pacino's Don is a ruthless hypocrite. In fact, he's a lying, murdering, thief. While he is solemnly taking his oath as godfather to his nephew, his minions are out in the streets slaughtering rivals wholesale -- and in the most graphic way.\"Never ask me about my business,\" he tells his wife. And one hopes she never does, unless she wants to wind up \"sleeping with the fishes.\"",

It also has a memorable score.One needs to see this on a nice widescreen DVD because it's so beautifully photographed with tons of greens, grays and browns that are just beautiful. It makes me want to visit Italy. The only reason I personally didn't rate it as high as others was I didn't like any of the characters, and especially the hot-headed James Caan. When he got riddled with bullets and was done with, a la \"Bonnie & Clyde,\" that was fine with me!There isn't as much violence as people might think, if they've never seen this movie. To some, this film might be too slow, in fact. However, when the violence or something dramatic occurs it is intense and can be very brutal. Who can ever forget a guy waking up with a dead, bloody horse in his bed?!! Like a good film noir, there is a lot of tension running throughout the Godfather films. Everybody is after somebody it seems and you never know whom to trust. That's part of the downsides of living a criminal life: constant paranoia. All this is put together nicely as we become close observers of the Corleone family, its family ties and its \"business.\"Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Robert DeNiro (later in the saga), Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, on and on - quite a cast and quite a movie. I enjoyed both sequels, too.I am also fortunate to own \"The Godfather Epic\" on tape, which must be some sort of collector's item by now.

Soon a mob war is triggered and nobody is truly safe.To call a film 'sprawling' might not be considered a compliment but here it is meant as one; for almost three hours we are shown ten years in the lives of one family. Highs and lows. It is a story that will see Michael transform from the man he wants to be to the man circumstances force him to be. It isn't a story that glorifies the mafia; it shows that these 'men of honour' have little... the day you are told your safety is assured is the day you are killed.

People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every wayThe film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.",

If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have \"The Godfather\" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a \"gang family\" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me \"One From The Heart\", shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as \"Peggy Sue Got Married\", another \"family\" theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. \"The Godfather\" is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story.

But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P.S. I was familiar with singer Al Martino way before his role in this film as my parents owned three of his record albums-This is Love, Spanish Eyes, and A Merry Christmas-that I used to listen quite frequently to as a kid during the '70s.",

        "text": "The Godfather is the greatest film ever made.It has the greatest critical and commercial successes in Hollywood as it gets everything right and has no shortcomings whatsoever.It exceeded expectations as the Mario Puzo's novel,from which the film was based on which itself a classic,and it also created a new standard and benchmark for the great American movie.Aside from that,it was one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time.In summary,it is the movie that provided the greatest on both excellence and entertainment.The story begins as Don Vito Corleone,the head of a New York Mafia \"family\", oversees his daughter's wedding. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and \"family\". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price.The epic film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton, together with John Cazale and Talia Shire.The film benefited greatly from the performance from its stellar cast especially from Brando as Don Vito Corleone,the head of the New York Mafia \"family\".Also,the actors who played his sons like Pacino as Michael,Cazale as Fredo and Caan as Sonny,were also outstanding in their performance. The cast was simply superb in this film.Other unforgettable features of this film is Nino Rota's haunting and memorable musical scores;the editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner;Dean Tavoularis's evocative set design; and the screenplay of Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola as well as the direction of Coppola. Overall,The Godfather is the ultimate family film that member of the household will enjoy and could relate to.",

        "text": "Spoilers herein.Building a life in film is not so much a matter of discovering the worthwhile films, but choosing which of those have the stuff worth building with. I have a clear understanding of what Scorsese is about, which I attribute to the Latin convention for storytelling. This convention is totally invested in characters, not situation or place or God help us, ideas. Scorsese's camera is attached to people, never place. His curiosity is always about people. This is a form of visual gossip that I eschew.So it is with Coppola. But his two projects (the Godfather and Apocalypse journeys) have another merit in how they work with what came before. Apocalypse is far more interesting in this respect. But `Godfather' is very clever in how it places itself. Gangster pictures began as a matter of a pretend world, and became ever more so as the genre matured. Mobsters lived in a world not unlike that of the Roadrunner,  always at a distance from reality, often winking at the audience.Coppola took his focus on the human to this genre. The film itself is no masterpiece without this placement, but is great with it. We inherit all the machinery and momentum of the genre to place behind the characters. Brando understood this, and alone is able to effect the transferral. Pacino would go on to sledgehammer his roles, but is appropriately subdued here.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

        "text": "Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.What's indicative of how powerful \"The Godfather\" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.Followed by two sequels, \"The Godfather\" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.10 out of 10.",

        "text": "Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my \"favorite movie\" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s.",

His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.",

So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.",

        "text": "Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" truly qualifies as the \"Gone with the Wind\" of gangster movies. The first installment in the Oscar-winning trilogy covers decades, mob wars, romances, intrigue, and treachery. Specifically, \"The Godfather\" received three Oscars. First, it was voted Best Picture; the Academy recognized Marlon Brando as Best Actor, and Coppola shares a Best Writing statuttee with Mario Puzo. Clocking in at a robust 175 minutes, \"The Godfather\" cast Brando as the seasoned Don Vito Corleone, with Al Pacino elbowing his way right behind him as the youngest son Michael. James Caan makes a lot of fuss as Pacino's older brother Sonny, and the ever dependable Robert Duval is cast as the consigliere for the family. Interestingly, Caan, Duval, and Pacino all competed for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola was up for Best Director. Dean Tavoularis' production designs, Warren Clymer's art direction, and Philip Smith's set decoration are all sumptuous. The best scenes include Michael's massacre at the restaurant, Carlo and his wife smashing dishes, Sonny's ambush in the causeway, Brando's death scene in the tomato patch, and the finale with the elimination of all of Michael's enemies. The screenplay deserved an Oscar. The least shall be first as Michael demonstrates during his meteoric rise to power. The dialogue contains quotable lines and several interesting characters who aren't relatives of the Corleone clan. Gordon Willis' shadowy, straight-on photography captures the treachery of the crime syndicate. Of course, \"The Godfather, Part II\" surpasses it in every respect, and it deserved the six Oscars that it garnered.",

        "text": "New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business. Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's. Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather. So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos. An all-time classic.",

        "text": "\"The Godfather\" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor, and while I haven't seen any other films with him, I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film. Al Pacino was also great in the film, and I think it was fairly early in his career. The film is character and plot driven, which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today. The film is never predictable, and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas. For a crime drama, it's very entertaining and interesting, for a drama, it's very well-paced, and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way. The plot is good, very well-written and interesting; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama, let alone one that takes almost three hours. It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame, the very first words that were spoken caught my attention, and didn't lose it for a second. It has a good pace, it doesn't rush through the scenes, yet it never gets stale or boring either. The acting is great, all the way around, every single actor does a great job. There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance. The characters were well-written, credible and well-developed. There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of, like it is with most new films, even dramas. The direction and editing is great, some of the cinematography is magnificent. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has some very quotable and memorable lines. The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way; it shows the ruthless killings that were, in fact, being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in. The film shows, with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence, how the mafia worked, and how big their influence was in the 1940's. A truly great piece of cinema, worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, especially fans of any of the actors, the director or crime dramas. Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films. 10/10",

They are not violent slice-of-life character-driven action films like Goodfellas or \"The Sopranos,\" which are a superb film and an extremely watchable cable series, respectively. The Godfather is, to my mind, superior filmmaking because of its propulsive narrative and iconic characters.What makes \"The Godfather\" great is that the characters in it know they are doing evil things, but rationalize it to themselves that \"the end justifies the means\". Coppola makes the hypocrisy and utterly failed values system pretty clear. A baptism inter-cut with scenes of murder...Vito Corleone is at his daughter's wedding, but sits there planning brutal mob stuff in his office...leave the gun take the cannoli...OK to cheat on your wife but \"dont discuss business at the table\" and so on.I had to watch this movie several times before I completely \"got\" it. The plot alone is very difficult to follow with all of the questions it raises. However it is one of those movies that rewards the viewers with those very questions for us to ponder and with its richness of story and character. The questions are about how people who regard themselves as \"good\" can do terrible things and justify it to themselves. \"The Godfather\" posits one of the universal problems in life - what is the nature of evil, and how can we recognize it in all its forms? How can people who do evil things think of themselves as basically \"good\" , how can they lie to themselves as they do?Central to all of this is the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone. He starts out as the returned all American WWII soldier with the respectable but outsider (in reference to \"The Family\") girlfriend, Kay, and by just doing what he thinks he must do to protect his family, one thing leads to another, and he ends up the cynical head of the Corleone crime family, morally miles from where he was when we first meet him.",

        "text": "No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two \"Godfather\" films, \"The Conversation,\" and \"Apocalypse Now\") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (\"Peggy Sue Got Married,\" \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\", the third \"Godfather\") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before \"Jack\" there was \"The Godfather.\" While I feel the whole \"Godfather\" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think \"The Conversation\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire \"Godfather\" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. \"The Godfather\" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, \"The Godfather\" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-",

Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece of cinema and one of the most memorable films of all time: Brando (Best Actor) gives a superb performance as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a Long Island crime family who faces all sorts of dilemmas, most of which embroil his youngest son Michael (Pacino in a star-making role), fresh from WWII, who takes on the awesome task of being the next leader in crime, violence and double-crossing. Great ensemble cast and some truly remarkable moments captured on film: offering film studio head Marley \"an offer he can't refuse\" resulting with a horse's head in bed; assassination attempts and successes (Caan's hot-tempered Sonny buying the farm at a toll booth massacre the likes of \"Bonnie and Clyde\") and the piece de resistance of baptism of Michael's' godson and the wiping out of his enemies is the stuff of Greek legend. Pure filmmaking at its best. Oscar winner for Best Picture, adapted screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his best seller) and some beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis (suggesting a Rembrandt painting come to life). Pacino, Caan and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor (all losing to Joel Grey in \"Cabaret\"). Kudos also to make-up guru Dick Smith for his realistic old age make up on Brando and also to Nina Rota's famous haunting foreboding score.",

        "text": "Based on the best-selling novel by the same name, this film begins in 1945 at a large party hosted by the head of the most powerful organized crime family in the United States \"Don Vito Corleone\" (Marlon Brando) to celebrate the marriage of his only daughter \"Connie Corleone\" (Talia Shire). As per Sicilian custom, several people have arrived to ask him a personal favor knowing that he cannot refuse during this particular event. It's also during this time that his youngest son \"Michael Corleone\" (Al Pacino) arrives having taken time off from his duties in the Marine Corps to attend. Unlike his older brothers \"Sonny Corleone\" (James Caan), \"Fredo Corleone\" (John Cazale) and his adopted brother \"Tom Hagen\" (Robert Duvall), Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision. Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned and-like it or not-Michael is soon thrust into the situation due to matters outside of his control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding film which combined great acting with a very deep and intricate plot. And to further illustrate its significance it was honored the following year with three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards as well. In short, this is an excellent movie I strongly recommend it to all viewers looking for a film of this sort.",

        "text": "Black screen. Cue the lone trumpet's haunting opening notes of Nino Rota's theme. Close up of a suffering man. \"I believe in America.\" That, my friends, is a powerful opening to a truly great film.It's been 40 years since it's original release, and this latest remastering looked and sounded amazing on Cinemark's largest screen. Following those opening moments, we get our first look at Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. On this screen, it was almost like seeing him for the first time ... a disquieting figure that oozes power and demands respect.There is no need for another review of this truly classic American film. Instead, this will offer a few observations (possible spoilers) and notes of interest ... combined with the highest possible recommendation to watch this one again!At its core, author Mario Puzo's story is about power, loyalty, trust and family. We witness what happens when one is viewed as having too much power. Loyalty is rewarded, and disloyalty brings the harshest possible penalty. Trust is gained over time, but lost in a flash. And family is the most complex subject of all.Over the years, there have been a few movies with more star-studded casts, but it's difficult to imagine a more perfectly selected cast: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda. Each of these actors have graced the screen in numerous roles, but for this three hour film, they become Corleones, associates, enemies, etc. There were a few things that jumped out at me during this viewing. The use of oranges (the fruit) contradicts the health benefits preached by the medical profession. Every time we see a bowl of fruit, a fruit stand or someone peeling, eating, or selecting an orange, a scene of doom (usually quite violent) is soon to follow. Carlo is even wearing an orange suit when Sonny (James Caan) shows up and paints the sidewalk with him. Don't miss the billboard featuring oranges that Sonny drives by just before he pulls up to the toll booth. Brando's final scene is preceded by him playfully scaring his grandson with an orange peel. I understand the importance of Vitamin C, but I think I'll stick with supplements!It's very interesting to note the camera angles throughout the movie. In an unusual approach, director Francis Ford Coppola uses an \"eye-level\" camera almost exclusively. This gives the viewer the feeling of being part of the scene, especially during the small group meetings within Corleone's dimly lit office. The few exceptions are the overhead shot of Corleone being shot, the Los Angeles cityscape, and a couple of shots at the wedding to emphasize the scale of the event.The famous \"Mattress Sequence\" was put together by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) for his friend Coppola. This is the segment after the Louis Restaurant shooting where we get a montage of B&W crime photos and newspaper headlines. These are real life crime photos and one of the shots is of Frank Nitti, Al Capone's trusted enforcer.It's quite fascinating to recognize how many \"classic\" lines of dialogue sprung from the movie, especially when you notice the minimalistic approach to dialogue used by Puzo and Coppola. Much of the communication is non-verbal body language, glances, nods and shrugs ... Brando, especially, is a master at this.One of the more remarkable facets of the film is the transformation of Michael (Al Pacino). We first see him as a dashing war hero relaxing at the wedding with his girlfriend (a baby-faced Diane Keaton). He is very laid back and kind of cocky with the thought that he can rise above the dirty family business. He sees himself as better than that. Watch the subtle changes in his appearance ... his hair, his posture, his eyes, even his hat! As great as Brando is as the Don, it's Pacino's performance that really takes the film to an unprecedented level. It's really fun to compare Michael's even-keeled, calm processing approach to the high-strung, act-now-think-later approach of his brother Sonny.The final note involves actor John Cazale. Here (and in part 2) he plays Fredo as a frightened, insecure puppy who is desperate to find his place. Imagine your father being Vito Corleone and your brothers are Sonny and Michael. It's to be expected that you might be overlooked and overpowered in conversation. The really interesting note about Cazale is that this was his feature film debut. He went on to make 4 more films before cancer took his life in 1978. Cazale made 5 films and all 5 were nominated for Best Picture (both Godfather films, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, The Deer Hunter). He was engaged to Meryl Streep at the time of his death.So the real point here is that if you ever doubt the magic and power of movies ... shut off your phone, close the blinds, take the cannoli, and let The Godfather absorb your thoughts. While you are at it, remember ... it's not personal, it's business (only you shouldn't really believe that).Thanks to Cinemark for making me an offer I couldn't refuse.",

After all, I love heavily dramatic, soapy stories, I recognize the quality of the cast, and my mother's side of the family comes from Sicily. With all those elements in place, why wouldn't I like a movie about the importance of family, Italian heritage, and loyalty?I'm not a fan of violence, but ironically, the version of The Godfather that I saw had been edited for appropriate television audiences. Much of the blood and violence was cut out, the swear words were muffled, and the sex scenes were deleted. The movie was only an hour long-just kidding! I don't know how or why this movie became so legendary, since to me, it felt like a B-picture starring a bloated, tired, low-energy Marlon Brando. This felt like a typical '70s movie, or an '80s television movie, with cheap production values and a has-been lead. I'll never, never understand why Marlon Brando was cast as the title role, and why, after his performance was seen during rehearsals, he wasn't replaced by someone else. Why wasn't Anthony Quinn cast? Marlon Brando must have patterned his famous, never-endingly mimicked accent after a relative or family friend, but among my Sicilian family line, and meeting people during my trips to Italy, no one has sounded even remotely like the cotton-mouthed, whispering, jaw-jutting \"Italian\" accent.I doubt I'm the only person in the world who doesn't like The Godfather or its sequels, but those of us who aren't fans are certainly quiet. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm sure you'll want to at least try it out, since there are so many famous moments to the first movie. There's the offer, the cannoli, the bag of fruit, the car bomb, the fishing trip, and of course, the horse's head. Marlon Brando scratches his jowls, James Caan is a royal jerk, and Al Pacino explains the difference between personal and business. But most importantly, there's tons of self-importance and an almost tongue-in-cheek seriousness that begs the question, why were there two sequels?Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the \"hysterical\" sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, \"The Godfather\" is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's \"Bullitt\"); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent \"love at first sight\" moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California.

        "text": "Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10",

It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.For one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.The acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

With both films declared the Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy in their separate years, I'd hate to argue the difference.In this case we should thank the executives at Paramount for retaining both director Francis Ford Coppola and the original The Godfather author Mario Puzo to put their talents to this film. I'd hate to think what would have happened in other hands. Certainly these two men knew their characters and knew how to expand on them. And the best thing about The Godfather: Part II is that one can pick up the story, at least the modern portion of this one without reference to the original. In fact viewing this film will give you a burning passion to see the first.Unlike The Godfather and The Godfather: Part III, this film runs on two parallel tracks. The modern story is a continuation of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone now residing on the shores of Lake Tahoe and now directing the family affairs from Nevada where the Corleone family is heavily into gambling as we well know organized crime was back in those days of the Fifties and Sixties. He's going into partnership with Lee Strassberg playing Hyman Roth, a thinly veiled portrait of Meyer Lansky. But there are a lot of things making Pacino hesitant about this move into Cuba under the Battista dictatorship.The prequel parallel story is how young Vito Corleone came to this country as an orphan and worked his way up to establish himself as a crime boss. Here Coppola does a brilliant job in capturing the flavor of pre-World War I New York in the Italian ghetto. Robert DeNiro is young Vito Corleone and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Remarkable when you consider that two of his rivals were Lee Strassberg from this film and Michael V. Gazzo playing Frankie Pantangeli from this film as well, the Mafia kingpin turned Senate witness modeled on Joe Valachi. DeNiro and Marlon Brando have the unique distinction as players of winning an Oscar for playing the same role.The woman do better in this film as in the original. Talia Shire got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category as Connie Corleone Rizzi. You remember her husband betrays the family and is killed in the original. She now is a drunken dependent on Pacino. Diane Keaton's character of Kay Adams Corleone is expanded here as well. She's a cultural outsider and the Sicilian vendetta code that she's expected to approve without comment becomes too much to bare. Her scene with Pacino when she tells him she's leaving him is one of the best for both in their respective careers.Overlooked unfortunately at award time was John Cazale as Fredo Corleone. He's the middle son who's passed over for succession after eldest son James Caan is killed in The Godfather. Fredo's big moment in The Godfather is being unable to fire his weapon in defense of his father being shot and how he breaks down.Fredo's got feelings as John Cazale dramatically points out.

Cazale has some of the best moments in this film.If the first Godfather film doesn't do it, The Godfather: Part II will have you permanently hooked on the inner workings and dynamics of the Corleone family both in the criminal and personal sense.",

        "text": "A lot of people seem to consider THE GODFATHER PART II to be the best film ever made, a film that's even better than it's already excellent predecessor. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While this movie is very good, and as well made as the original, I think the original has the edge.The reason for that is the script, which was just better, and more involved, the first time around. Here, there are dual narratives, one of which follows the traditional sequel route of showing that happened to the Corleone family after the events of the first movie, while the second is a prequel revealing how Vito Corleone became the mafia boss he ended up as.While I love Robert De Niro and I enjoyed the flashback scenes, I felt this whole sequence was slightly unnecessary. From the material given, the viewer can already guess how the De Niro character rose through the ranks and the events we witness feel a little bit superfluous. Sure, the pair of assassination scenes are excellent, but the rest just feels obvious and expected.Meanwhile, the Pacino narrative also has its problems, although cast and director aren't at fault; Coppola reunites many of his principals here and to excellent effect. However, there isn't nearly as much incident in the narrative and the whole story feels a little dragged out, a little over-emphasised. In the first film, the Pacino character had three or four major plot points to deal with, whereas this time the events are limited; for example, the entire film focuses on the situation with Roth, whereas in THE GODFATHER that would have just taken up half an hour or so. Therefore the ending, when it comes, is admittedly powerful, but not as effective in comparison to the genuinely amazing things we saw in the first film. It's been done before, and apart from a little more depth and character focus, we can't take much more away from this sequel. So it's very good, but not quite up there to the level of the first.",

        "text": "The Godfather Part II (1974) **** (out of 4) Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece shows the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) who tries to rise in power and seek revenge after his parents are murdered. In the current times, Michael (Al Pacino) survives an assassination attempt and goes to find out who was behind it as well as destroy anyone who might be trying to do the family any harm. There's always going to be a debate on whether this film or the first is the best but for my money I have to hand it to this sequel. While both movies are great, I think this one works so well for numerous reasons but the biggest being that not only is a great sequel by continuing the events of the first film but it's also a great prequel by showing the life of Vito.I've always had a few minor problems with the original movie but I think it would be fair to say that this one here is flawless in every way. Coppola does such a masterful job at making sure everything was on par with the original but you can tell he knew people were going to be questioning him attempting to do a sequel so he wanted to make sure that he delivered even more. As with the first film, this one here has that very slow pace that wouldn't be allowed in any movie today but thankfully the 70s were a much different time. Coppola perfectly uses this slower pacing to really get inside the heads of these people and he really delivers so much character development that you're amazed that so much is able to be done in its epic 200-minute running time. Even more amazing is how quickly the film flies by, which is saying a lot of consider the length and pace.Of course, no one could ever say a negative thing about the performances and they're all masterful. I had really forgotten how wonderful Pacino was here but he's so chilling, cold and deadly quiet that you really do begin to fear him. I'm certainly not going to spoil anything but if you've seen the movie then you know what happens at the end and how Pacino plays this was just a masterful touch. DeNiro, picking up his first Oscar, does a wonderful job too. Doing the Italian language and mastering is obviously impressive but so are the small touches that he brings that connects the character to the later one played by Marlon Brando in the previous film. John Cazale is often overlooked but he has some terrific moments here as does Talia Shire, Robert Duvall and especially Diane Keaton.THE GODFATHER PART II contains all the greatness of the first film and it's a real miracle that Coppola was able to match it and deliver even more. The film works on so many levels but being able to pretty much see two movies rolled into one is something of a lost art. Even rarer is how perfectly both parts are as the drama, tension, violence and pain are all on full display and there's no question that this film deserves its reputation as one of the greatest ever made.",

I wonder if one could look at organized criminals like one might look at a mideast country, because they have their own principalities, their own history, almost their own religion. They have parceled out their land and protect against invaders. They fear and react to threats from the outside, from \"non-family\" members.The product they sell is terror. Of course, all participants live on the edge. Their human failings are dismissed and magnified as weakness and disloyalty. Brothers kill brothers. I haven't a lot to add because I am not a film expert. As uncomfortable as this film makes me (like the first one), I continue to watch.

        "text": "Michael Corleone continues his rise within organised crime in 1950's America, by expanding his family's empire across hotels and casinos.  When an attempt on his life fails Michael proceeds with his dealings in Cuba with Hyman Roth, a deal that will not be as straightforward as it appears. Meanwhile we are told the story of a young Vito's move to American and his rise from the ghetto up into the world of organised crime.I don't know what I can actually add to the sheer weight of praise that has been heaped onto this film - it is as accomplished a film as everyone says and is rightly one of the few examples of a sequel improving and building on a film.  The plot follows two separate strands, the continuing rise of Michael that is as much detrimental to his family as it is beneficial to his pocket; the other thread being Vito's arrival in America as a child and his rise up within the Italian ghettos.  The two stories are not as intertwined as I had remembered - they are very separate and the film can go for quite a while before it switches over.  In a way this works better as it allows both stories to go ahead without fragmenting either too much.This film, as with many gangster films, has been accused of glamorising the life of crime and those involved in it, however, if anything Godfather II does this even less than the original did.  The film shows the moral collapse of Michael in the same way as the first showed his power.  In fairness it does contrast the rise of the two dons - showing how Vito manages to keep his family together.  Despite this I would still argue that Michael's path is far from glamorous.The two narratives are both excellent but for different reasons.  Vito's rise is very interesting and provides solid back story to the first film and we can clearly see the change in Vito from a quiet young man to the influential powerbroker that he became - we also sadly see the rise in his demons and his viciousness.  Meanwhile Michael's tread sees more powerful deals and double crosses as he continues to gain more power.  This was overly complicated for me the first time I saw it but, with reviewing it I have gotten more from it each time - more understanding and more enjoyment. The twin stories are both engaging and the three hour plus running time passes effortlessly - this is a saga and it never feels like the running time was anything more than what was necessary.The cast are fantastic.  Naturally the kudos go to the two leads, and they deserve it.  Pacino has a less showy role than in the first film as he has already done his falling - here we only see further proof of the corrupting nature of his power.  De Niro steals the film this time with a measured performance that parallels Michael's change in the first film - it is a performance that lacks a certain amount of personality but shows us the traits that the film is interested in.  As before the support cast are great, Duvall is reliable as ever, while the most improved role goes to Cazale, who's Fredo becomes more important to the story and almost becomes a biblical character.  Quality comes in waves with Shire, Strasberg, Spradlin, Kirby and many others with solid performances.  Keaton is good but she is not given as much time as I would have liked, even if her scenes are important and powerful.Overall this is a great film that is based on a classy pair of stories that bring the subtexts with them and a collection of characters that are well developed by a script and some great actors.  It may be a little too lavish and plush for my own personal tastes, but it is a rich story.  To a certain degree the production values and sheer class of this film could be accused of glamorisation, but generally those who say this have managed to totally miss the fact that this is a cautionary tale that shows the corruption of power.",

So while this is the first movie that includes Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in one movie, the time line constraints did not allow for them to be in the same scene (wouldn't make any sense, you'll understand when and if you have watched the movie). Also De Niro won an Oscar (funny fact, for the same role/character Marlon Brando won one in the first Godfather, must be a first and I don't know if it happened again, doubt it though) while Al Pacino didn't. And while it may seem unfair to Pacino, it was more than well deserved for De Niro, who really merged himself into the character that Brando created. From the way he talked, to gestures to mannerisms. Everything is there!But the movie won a few Oscars and the acting was really good too. The story continues (though gives us a few flashbacks) from the ending of part 1. So while the first one is conclusive and has a satisfying ending itself, the story could be continued. Especially with the original author on board (Mr. Puzzi). There are new themes introduced in this movie. One big one is loneliness. And it's not only about being alone when you have power or being the Godfather. As with the first movie this explores quite a lot of things in Gang related family living.A great movie that was even longer than the first one (and the sequel that came after it). But you probably won't mind the length. Especially if you buy into the drama, that really works. And even without it stating the time jumps/leaps it makes, you'll get the (time) change on your own.

Masterfully tracing the history of the Corleone Family from Vito's arrival at Ellis Island in 1901 to the Lake Tahoe empire of 1958, the story is a decades spanning saga that makes you wonder how almost three and a half hours can blow by so quickly. The picture's numerous flashback scenes work well to establish the beginnings of Don Corleone's rise to power, and Robert de Niro's portrayal of the young Vito effectively allow us to forget about asking why Marlon Brando didn't show up even once. Pacino is no longer the fresh faced kid home from the military who takes up the family business, but the brooding, brutal leader of a crime syndicate with a chessboard strategy of staying two and three steps ahead of his enemies at all times.If you haven't seen the movie in a long time, you might be surprised like I was while watching today. It's easy to recall the highlights like Frank Pentangeli's courtroom scene and subsequent suicide, and the way Fredo met his timely demise. What I had long forgotten was the way the picture opens with the Sicilian back story, and the way the New York neighborhood flashback thread literally runs throughout the entire picture. It's funny how I recall those scenes as a single sequence leading up to the murder of Don Fanucci, but it just goes to show you how faulty memory can be.You know, it's hard to believe that the first two Godfather movies are nearing the forty year mark since their original release. They've become American classics that have well withstood the test of time, and will continue maintain their appeal. It's fair to say that seeing both of these iconic films are a must for the true cinema fan.",

Picking up where the first film left off, we see the Corleones' control over Las Vegas. Also, Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved with Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), one of his father's former cohorts. Meanwhile, in flashbacks, we see young Vito Andolini immigrate from the town of Corleone, Sicily, to New York City in the early 20th century. As he ages (the adult Vito is played by Robert DeNiro), Vito becomes increasingly involved in Mafia business.The climax (at least in my opinion, it was the climax) happens in Cuba on New Year's Eve in 1958. You may recall that the Mafia helped prop up Fulgencio Batista and his reign of terror. Anyway, while Michael and Fredo (John Cazale) are at a party at the Presidential Palace, Michael angrily yells at Fredo \"I know it was you, Fredo! You broke my heart!\" At that moment, just as it turns into 1959, the revolutionary forces enter Havana, proclaiming the revolution's victory. The combination of these two events shows that things won't be the same anymore, whether in the Corleone family or in Cuba. To be certain, Kay (Diane Keaton) has some unexpected news for Michael when he returns home.The point is, this movie disproves the notion that all sequels suck. This sequel is a masterpiece, with splendid performances by Pacino, Keaton, DeNiro, Cazale, Strasberg, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. But of course, most of all, this movie's superbness owes to director Francis Ford Coppola. He knows exactly how to make a movie, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 10/10.",

You lose Marlon Brando, but you get Robert DeNiro. I consider that a fair trade.This film has two things going for it: it has the early years of Don Corleone, which really fills in the missing mythos around the family. Without this, the film would appear to show the Corelones were always powerful, which is far from the truth. It does not explain how Don Corelone grew to talk in such a mumbled voice, though.Also, I really enjoyed the entire Cuba sequence, because it put the film in a historical time frame (and I like Cuba). I was never fully sure when the first film was taking place, but this one made sure I knew the years when Don Coreleone was growing up and that the present day was not 1974, but rather in roughly 1958-1959. That changed my perspective on things completely.If you have invested three hours in the first film, invest three more in this one. Why only get half the story of Vito Corleone?

Actually, the story itself is less important than the fact that the film naturally divides itself in two -- its execution and its moral message.The execution is splendid in every regard. Coppola's direction is deliberately paced. There is a conspicuous absence of unsubtle and dizzying directorial razzle-dazzle, thank God -- a movie that doesn't give you a headache.The performances are nearly flawless. There isn't a sour note in the entire cast, and especially outstanding is the acting of Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo (author of \"A Hatfull of Rain\"), and Gastone Moschin as Don Fanucci, who tackles the role with an understated grandiosity -- what operatic flourishes! But everyone is good.The photography by Gordon Willis, as in its predecessor, is dominated by a burnished amber except for wintry Lake Tahoe where various shades of blue and a steely gray predominate. The production designer deserves credit. Nino Rota's orchestral score is memorable, a folksy melancholic tune. The script has some neat tag lines. When Strasberg and Pacino meet, they shake hands and exchange warm wishes, then when Pacino admits that he's going to kill a colleague of Strasberg, the latter shrugs, turns to his tuna fish sandwich, and says, \"He's small potatoes.\" It's a chilling moment. The avuncular, sentimental old man is a ruthless murderer. That's the execution. The -- I don't know what to call it. I don't like the term \"moral of the movie.\" Sounds like a high school term paper. And I'm not sure exactly what \"intentionality\" means in phenomenology, so I'll just say \"intention.\" The intention of the film is thoroughly corrupt. Maybe Puzo and Coppola realized it, maybe not.I think the director did, though. That's why he splices so much carnage into the rituals. Almost every scene of violence takes place during some sort of party or religious festival. I think -- I HOPE -- that Coppola was aware of the irony between the rites of intensification and the fact that the principles they embody are ignored almost at will. It's important to have your baby baptized as soon as possible, just as it's important to shoot a miscreant in the chest.In a sense all the rituals, all the religion, are fakes. There is no license permitted, unlike Irish wakes, Polish weddings, or Russian parties. If, like Gazzo, you have too much wine and accidentally spill some on the vast tablecloth at an al fresco party, the glances are severe. No sexy dancing either. In a way, despite the faux gaiety, it's something like living in a prison, especially for women.We're supposed to feel sorry for Michael who, at the end, is seen sitting alone in solemn grandeur, emotionally bankrupt. But Michael is really a rat who deserves everyone's contempt and execution by the state. It doesn't matter that he's young, handsome, well-spoken, powerful and rich. He's broken more laws than anyone can count. He lies, cheats, and murders at will. Those murders include an innocent whore who is horribly butchered simply in order to entrap the Senator from Nevada in Michael's thrall. He betrays his friends. He throws out his wife and prevents her from taking \"his\" children. He murders his own brother for a past mistake for which he's already been punished.The original Don Corleone, Marlon Brando, had a set of allegiances extending outward from the family at its center -- to his ethnic group, his neighborhood, his co-conspirators in the business, and beyond that to some vague construct called \"the nation.\" Al Pacino's Don has whittled it all down. At the center is ego, and beyond that, business. He's become a classical villain, a Richard III who has plucked down that crown, and if he now has buyer's remorse -- well, he should have thought things out earlier. His tragedy is nothing compared to mine, which has been Shakespearean in its grandeur, really. In my adolescence, the love of my life, Juliet, poisoned herself. And when, in all modesty, I tried to become Emperor of Rome, the treacherous bastards assassinated me.",

Two films for the price of one!Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, only half of this 'double-bill' is really worth the time and effort. The flashbacks are great, with Robert De Niro superb as the young adult Vito, rising from shop assistant to mob boss; these parts reminded me of the excellent Once Upon A Time In America, which also charted the early lives of young gangsters (and which also starred De Niro). In contrast, the scenes featuring Michael's continuing underworld activities in the '50s are far too convoluted and slow for their own good, making keeping up with the Corleones more of a chore than a pleasure.8/10 for the flashbacks; 4/10 for the rest.

Both could work as perfect single films on their own; together it's like a double album of the dark side of crime and the perilous nature of rising up in America as an immigrant. It's spectacular in many ways, masterpiece in fact, and has become as important as the first one (it is the only sequel to win an Oscar for best picture in those terms) and the acting all around is well-knit (even the pioneer himself Lee Strasberg is on hand as Roth), the score is possibly better in some ways to the first film, and most of the scene work is fantastic. One thing that attracted me to this film is also what I believe is one of the all-time great breakthrough performances in any film, as Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone has all of that confidence as an actor without channeling too much Brando. If there would be one reason to see the film and recommend it it would be because of him, as he gives one of his tour de force career turns in that streak of one after another in the 70s. Pacino is practically as good with enough lines that are realistically grounded but also highly quotable at times (the \"in my home\" bit is priceless). John Cazale, by the way, is also an element to make the film work as one of two performances that he'll be remembered for twenty years down the line (the other being Dog Day Afternoon). In short, it's just a very well done picture.",

Here, they're both still being somewhat underused but Ms. Keaton has a great scene when she reveals what really happened to her upcoming baby and Ms. Shire has a nearly as such scene when she mentions Fredo near the end. Speaking of whom, John Cazale is fine in reprising the role as the weak Corleone brother. And Al Pacino was probably at his very best in this, his second feat at portraying Michael Corleone especially during scenes with his mentor Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth. Francis Ford Coppola is aces as both the co-writer (with creator Mario Puzo) and director as he handles scenes from both the late '50s concerning Michael and the early 20th century concerning his father Vito, here played in an Oscar-winning turn by Robert De Niro speaking mostly in Italian. So on that note, I highly recommend The Godfather: Part II.",

        "text": "If The Godfather is the greatest film ever made,then The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made. It is Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken until present. The Godfather Part II chronicles the story of the Corleone family following the events of the first film while also depicting the rise to power of the young Vito Corleone,played by excellently Robert De Niro in his Academy Award winning performance.The film stars Al Pacino, Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,Robert De Niro,Talia Shire, John Cazale, Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strasberg.The movie is a depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him - - a familial legacy then upended by Michael's business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay and turned his brother, Fredo, against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.The film still has a strong performance from the cast despite not having Marlon Brando in it.Aside from De Niro,Al Pacino, Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale and Lee Strasberg provide honest performances. Still present in the film is the haunting score of Nino Rota;the superb screenplay of both Puzo and Coppola; and the excellent direction of Copolla.But it has darker themes as compared to the first film as the characters are violent and amoral in their values.Also,the story presents the deterioration of the characters as the viewers feel for them in their pain and vulnerability. It may not be the ultimate family picture but nevertheless,it remains as the greatest sequel ever made and definitely one of the best films ever made.",

        "text": "\"I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out. Just my enemies.\" So says Michael Corleone (AL PACINO) in THE GODFATHER: PART II.Pacino plays the part with somber seriousness that becomes a bit one dimensional by the time the film is midway over. Nor is the story as compelling as the first Godfather film. But you have to hand it to director Coppola, he keeps the viewer glued to the screen even when the pauses between dialog is a bit longer than needed. (No wonder the film is so long!!). And with the risk of being politically incorrect, you can almost smell the garlic in every scene, so realistic are the accents and the background flavor of the entire film.So many plot developments are almost throwaways because the screenplay seems to be deliberately ambiguous about certain plot elements. And yet, the film has a certain holding power and all of the performances are more than competent. Especially poignant--and chilling--is the scene where Fredo's fishing expedition takes place with stormy looking clouds setting the eerie scene to perfection as the expected murder takes place.With murderous intentions just around the corner in practically every scene, it's a fascinating film to watch, especially since the murders themselves are so deftly handled by the actors involved. DIANE KEATON is especially convincing in the final confrontation with Pacino.I don't think GODFATHER II compares favorably to the original film with Brando, particularly since it's not always successful in telling two stories--the one involving the young Vito (ROBERT DeNIRO) and the present story--but it still packs a wallop when it gets to the intense moments. The double strand of stories doesn't always mesh well, a weakness of structure that hurts the film. Despite this major flaw, it's a superior piece of film-making.",

It is more edgy and is less likely to linger with Portrait like introductions to already known participants. There are more interesting themes here like the expansion to Las Vegas, and the formation of the Family's Patriarch and sensibilities, and the Senate Hearings.This one moves quite a bit faster than the original because it has much more to say. It says it and then some. Michael's descent into internal Madness is not a pretty sight and the Inheritor to all that is Corleone becomes a very unlikable Tyrant and shows virtually no signs of Humanity as the Modernity of events that take place have no place for that sort of thing.",

        "text": "The continuation of the Godfather saga with two focuses: the ongoing story of the Corleone family, and Michael in particular, and Vito Corleone's (Michael's father) backstory. Regarding the ongoing Michael Corleone story, it is about seven years since the events that concluded The Godfather. With the murders of the heads of the other four New York / New Jersey families, the Corleone family has unassailable control in New York. The move to Nevada went smoothly and Michael Corleone controls several hotels and casinos in the state. Frank Pentageli, the man who runs Michael's interests in New York, comes to Michael, asking if he can take out the Rosato Brothers as they are infringing on Pentageli's turf and business interests. However, the Rosatos are backed by Hyman Roth, a business partner of Michael's and a long- time ally of Michael's father, Vito Corleone, and Michael refuses. An attempted assassination attempt is then carried out on Michael's life, in his own home. Michael investigates who is trying to kill him, and suspects that there is a traitor in his family. Meanwhile. Michael and Hyman Roth fly to Cuba to finalise some business deals there. The Cuban trip reveals all. In a story interwoven with the present day, we see the backstory to Vito Corleone. From how his parents and brother were murdered by a Don in their home town of Corleone in Sicily, to his escaping, as a boy, to New York, his adult life and his rise to Don Corleone.A great follow-up to one of the greatest movies ever made. Gritty, solid plot, superb direction by Francis Ford Coppola and excellent performances. The closing scenes are incredibly powerful, showing just how much Michael has changed from the innocent man we met at the start of the first movie.Six Oscar wins, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Robert De Niro won a Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Vito Corleone, making two Oscar wins for two different actors playing the same character (Marlon Brando got a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in the first Godfather). Al Pacino, Michael V Gazzo, Lee Strasburg (of method acting fame) and Talia Shire also received acting Oscar nominations.Not quite in the same league as the first movie though. The first one had a much tighter plot and better pacing: this does feel a bit padded and slow at times. Not as enthralling and tension-filled as the first.

As a matter of fact \"The Godfather: Part II\" even ranks above the sublime \"The Godfather\", which got made 2 years earlier, starring mostly the same cast.The movie connects nicely with the first movie and decides to start off were the first movie had finished. Michael is the new Don now and he continues his father work by leading a crime syndicate based in New York. Besides the usual struggles with other the other families and other characters who are looking for opportunities to gain more power and control, Michael also needs to handle his personal life with his wife and his other family members, who aren't all on the same line.But \"The Godfather: Part II\" is not just a movie that continues what the first movie had started. It also adds a story-line of the young Vito Corleone, played in the first movie by Marlon Brando. In this movie he is being portrayed by Robert De Niro, who wasn't really a big star yet at the time. It's amazing how these two different story-lines, set at completely different time periods and also in essence have really nothing to do with each other, blend in so perfectly. The historical settings of the New York of the early 20th century are also truly impressive.It's a movie that got practically made by the same cast and crew as the first successful movie. Of course there also are some new addition to the cast this time, in which the earlier mentioned Robert De Niro and Lee Strasberg impress the most. Both also received an Oscar nomination in the category for best supporting actor, along with Michael V. Gazzo but it was Robert De Niro who would eventually take the statue back home. What also makes this movie an even better one than its predecessor is the fact that this movie is filled with some classic moments of cinema. It contains some of the best known sequences and phrases. It also contains some great constructed and build-up sequences, for which the credit really needs to go to Francis Ford Coppola. Also the characters are more developed and expanded in this movie. A true accomplishment for a movie with so many characters in it but then again the movie has also more than 3 hours to tell its story.A sequel that even surpasses its brilliant predecessor.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

        "text": "It's rare to see a sequel that is as good as the first; it's even rarer to see the two acting veterans, De Niro and Pacino, together in a film. This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's acting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but overall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10",

        "text": "No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two \"Godfather\" films, \"The Conversation,\" and \"Apocalypse Now\") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (\"Peggy Sue Got Married,\" \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\", the third \"Godfather\") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before \"Jack\" there was \"The Godfather.\" While I feel the whole \"Godfather\" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think \"The Conversation\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire \"Godfather\" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. \"The Godfather\" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, \"The Godfather\" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.Grade: Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-",

Knowing that he is now a target as well the 9 year old boy escapes on a ship to New York and not long afterward arrives in Ellis Island where he is given the last name of \"Corleone\". The film then fast forwards 57 years with \"Michael Corleone\" (Al Pacino) presiding over a party for his young son's First Communion party in Nevada. As is customary he meets with those who need to see him with one particularly powerful person named \"Senator Pat Geary\" (G. D. Spradlin) using the opportunity to attempt to extort some money from him. Little does he know just how vicious Michael actually is and the senator soon changes his tune not long after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film constantly shifts its attention from the now grown \"Vito Corleone\" (played by Robert DeNiro) to his adult son Michael after he inherited the title of Godfather from his father. To that effect, although I didn't particularly care for the repeated flashbacks, the stories of both individuals are so riveting that it didn't really matter that much to me. Likewise, while sequels often fail in comparison to the original film, many people feel that this particular picture is as good as its predecessor and the fact that it won an Oscar for \"Best Picture\" and received numerous other Academy Award nominations certainly strengthens that argument. On that note, while I agree that this is an excellent film, I have rated it just slightly below the original movie.",

        "text": "Six weeks ago was The Godfather in a theatre setting. This time it was the sequel, which generated an equal amount of movie bliss. Experiencing these two classic movies on the big screen almost 40 years after release reinforces what great films they are  and how few truly great films get made. We are reminded that a powerful well-written story, world class cast, visionary director, brilliant photographer and stunning composer are all necessary components for movie greatness.This sequel explores three time periods: the journey of 9 year old Vito to the U.S., his rise to power in Little Italy, and Corleone life after Vito's death. Some find the cuts to varying timelines to be distracting. Personally, I find it fascinating and a very effective way to tell the entire story. Watching an almost mute 9 year old Vito land on Ellis Island and transform into a twenty-something community \"leader\" is one of the more powerful and unlikely events ever seen on screen. Mix that with Al Pacino holding little back as a power-mongering Michael is downright frightening. If you doubt this, look at it from the perspective of Diane Keaton's May, or John Cazale's Fredo.The film received 11 Oscar nominations and won 6, including Best Picture. Robert DeNiro won for his tremendous turn as young Vito. This is early DeNiro  the Mean Streets, Taxi Driver era. DeNiro and Marlon Brando remain the only two actors to have won Oscars for playing the same character. Two other acting nominations went to Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V Gazzo as Pentangeli. Mr. Strasberg was the famed acting teacher whose prized pupils included none other than Al Pacino (who talked him into taking this role). Strasberg was also bequeathed 75% of the Marilyn Monroe estate and there was much scandal after his death when his widow auctioned off most of it.A couple of other interesting points were that most of this script was original for the film, though the background story of Vito was drawn from Mario Puzo's novel. Director Francis Ford Coppola considered casting Joe Pesci as the young Clemenza, but ultimately decided on Bruno Kirby. Dominic Chianese plays Hyman Roth's right hand man Johnny Ola. Chianese has been recently seen in both The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire. B-Movie mogul Roger Corman plays one of the Senators on the committee interrogating Michael and Pentangeli. Harry Dean Stanton plays one of the FBI bodyguards, and former heartthrob Troy Donahue plays Connie's (Talia Shire) goofy boyfriend Merle. One of my favorite characters in the film is Don Fanucci, robustly played by Gastone Moschin. His strutting and preening always creeps me out and makes me laugh.Besides being the first sequel to win a Best Picture Oscar, The Godfather II is simply one of the finest films ever made. At 200 minutes, it requires both a time and mental commitment, but along with The Godfather, Coppola and Puzo have provided us exemplary story telling through expert filmmaking.",

Diane Keaton's \"I had an abortion!\" monologue is grating on the nerves, in part because of her poor acting and in part because of her character's stupidity.

The other, much more famous part to the film is Al Pacino's \"kiss of death\". You can take ten seconds and watch that clip, or you can sit down and watch the entire three and a half hours.Robert De Niro shows up in this movie, in an oddly-lit, hazy saturated, flashback to Vito Coleone's youth.

        "text": "RELEASED IN 1974 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, \"The Godfather: Part II\" is part sequel and part flashback to the first film with the main story focusing on Michael (Al Pacino) in the late 50s as the stalwart Corleone son who has taken over as 'Godfather' with events taking place at Lake Tahoe, Miami, New York City, Havana (during the Cuban Revolution), and a congressional committee in Washington DC. The flashbacks concern Vito Corleone as a kid in Sicily and his arrival to Ellis Island with the story focusing on Vito's life in New York City when he was in his mid-to-late 20s (Robert De Niro) where he cleverly and boldly establishes himself as the formidable new Don.MAIN CAST: Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom, while John Cazale appears as the weakest Corleone son, Fredo. Diane Keaton returns as Michael's wife, who tries to put out of her mind her husband's shady business with Talia Shire reprising the role of Corleone sister, Connie.The good news is that the flashbacks pertaining to Vito (De Niro) are good, starting with the shocking opening scenes. The saga of Michael (Pacino), by contrast, is relatively dull, particularly the first half, which mostly involves overlong scenes of talky drama. Michael's story simply lacks the energy and highlight-every-15-minutes of the prior film. Moreover, Pacino is thoroughly one-note solemn as Michael, lacking the character's interesting story arc in the first installment and the dimension of the third. I'm not blaming Pacino, as he simply played the role as written and does it well. I'm just saying that he's not a very captivating character, particularly compared to Brando or De Niro as Vito. He's just too one-dimensional and therefore uninteresting. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half culminating with an explosive showdown between Michael and Kay, which had to happen in light of the climatic scene of the previous movie.The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Life's hard enough without taking that shady route.Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with some highlights, but IMHO it's not in the same league as the first movie in overall entertainment. It's good for what it is, but it's overrated by people who can't see beyond nostalgia-tinged glasses. If you're a fan of the first film it's almost mandatory that you watch this one; just don't expect the same dynamic greatness. I know it's sacrilege to say this, but Part II is on par with Part III in tone and quality, although I personally give Part III the edge in all-around entertainment value.THE FILM RUNS 3 hours & 22 minutes (overlong) and was shot in Sicily & Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy; the New York City area; Lake Tahoe, California; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Acireale, Catania; Las Vegas; and Washington DC. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo.GRADE: B",

Story continues the saga of the Corleone family, which sees the return of Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, and John Cazale. Robert De Nero joins the cast as a young Vito Corleone, who is forced to leave his native Sicily as a boy, then arrives in New York city, where he grows to be an ambitious man who challenges a local corrupt gangster, takes him out in memorable fashion, then sets up the beginning of his empire. Film contrasts that with the ambitions of his son Michael, who is building his father's business in ways he never would have imagined, but in ways that will come at a very high cost indeed...Just as engrossing as the first, with a brilliant script and performances. A timeless classic that won Academy Awards for Best Picture(like Part I), supporting actor De Nero, but also for director Coppola himself(overdue!)",

Sure Alfredo was never brilliant or vicious but he was sweet, gentle, and warm most of the time. He had a conscience and I despise Michael for killing his own brother. I think he killed him out of jealousy. Alfredo spent more time with Michael's son, Anthony, than he did and he resented him for it. Alfredo could have been spared. Four years after Godfather Part II, John Cazale died of cancer after filming the Deer Hunter. He never won an Oscar or made too many films but he made every role memorable. Rest in Peace, John.

The beauty and symmetry of the lighting, sets, mixes with the symbolisms of the Catholic church, America, and family was directed brilliantly. The statue of liberty scene is a classic.

The \"senator we are all part of the same hypocrisy\" resonates what the film is about. De Niro aka Vito brilliants acts out a story of a man pushed into crime who is a ruthless killer, and also plays with his children. De Niro's dualism creates ironic realism of the Vito character. The Godfather Part two sub stories of betrayal, honor, dishonor, corruption, and the damage of the characters' sin is a story which leaves an impact.

        "text": "The original \"Godfather\" ended with Kay literally being shut out of her husband's business (a deafening statement on her future). The same thing happens again in \"Part II\" but with devastating results. And that's emblematic of the movie as a whole; it marks every box on the sequel checklist (more this, bigger that) but in the context of a profoundly downbeat story. The brilliance of this film is the use of flashbacks to a young Vito Corleone (De Niro). It's contrasting his rise with Michael's fall and moral decay, tracking the various bombshells in each man's life (the hits on Fanucci and Ciccio, an abortion, 'You broke my heart, Fredo.\"). It's ideal for showing just how badly Michael is operating under the strain of power. The paranoia is palpable. \"The Godfather: Part II\" is always the movie that's cited when discussing superior sequels. I don't know that I'd go that far, but I think it's a fantastic movie regardless, and certainly warrants any claims to greatness. If anything, it lacks the original's tight and near-perfect packaging, but makes up for that in undeniable ambition. Both are exceptional, but for different reasons. 8/10",

Robert DeNiro's performance is flawless. It can never be touched. The story is amazing. I love the story between Michael and Kay. There was such anger and betrayal, that I couldn't wait to see how it ended in the 3rd one. From what I've seen, I can say that Part 2 is my favorite. Then the 1st and then the 3rd.

I am thankful to have just viewed the Coppola 2007 restoration of this film.At well over 3 hours, it is longer than the original. What is does is deftly fill in 2 stories that we saw small parts of in the first film. We find out how the Don, Vito Cordleone got his name, what his real name is, and the history that made him who he was in the first film.The second story fills in more about his kids, particularly Michael, and how he took over in the late 1950's and his battles with one of his dads enemies. The back drop moves from Nevada to Sicily, and then to Havana. Michael faces down a series of folks including a Congressional Hearing about his life.While this has no Brando, it has an excellent cast from the first film with some additional folks added. James Caan makes a brief cameo at the end of the movie. Talia Shire & Diane Keaton head up to female cast though these films seems to have a cast of 100's because there are so many parties & events.The film keeps with the same strength as the first film, strong storytelling which brings you in and peeks your interest enough to keep you going.

A film like \"The Matrix Reloaded\" is a sequel - \"The Godfather Part II\" is something more. It's just too good to be called a sequel.The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in \"The Godfather Part II,\" Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. \"The Godfather\" was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. \"The Godfather Part II\" may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a \"sequel\" almost seems insulting.",

The 'Godfather: Part II (1974)' is an oddity in more ways than one, since it simply shouldn't work but totally does. There's almost no way you could believe that the piece powers past the three-hour mark, which it does thanks mainly to its unneeded and honestly less interesting flashback plots seemingly disconnected from the main story. There's not a moment in the foremost narrative I'd suggest cutting even for a second, and even those flashback bits are breathlessly entertaining (in a much more instantly gratifying way than the slow-burning main narrative.) Every second of the picture adds up to an experience that seems sweepingly massive yet strangely intimate, an effortlessly engaging examination of the fall of an empire and the nostalgic sadness at the heart of a man whose soul is slowly turning to stone. 8/10.",

        "text": "By tracing a parallel story between Vito's ascension to power and the consolidation of this very power by his son Michael, \"The Godfather Part II\" has an epic scope that remarkably contrasts with the 'intimate feeling' of the first opus. Yes, there's a cruel lack of warmth, of genuine love, of this very 'Family spirit' that cemented the iconic greatness of \"Part I\" but that's because the very purpose of the film is to show another kind of intimacy, the one between Politics, Business and Crime, as to highlight a sort of inner perversity in the American Dream. This is also why the film is regarded as an epic.In \"Part II\", it's not a Five-Families-war that structures the plot anymore, so there's no need for this 'team spirit' anymore, we're far from the good old days with Sonny, Hagen, Tessio and Clemenza, when the Corleones were fighting for their survival. The bigger your territory gets, the more invisible is your enemy ... so invisible he can even be one of your own. Indeed, even the first film ended with a betrayal from Tessio, Vito's trustful capo-regime, a shock that foreshadowed the idea expressed by Michael in \"Part II\", the fact that \"loyalty relies on business\". What a world where you can't call your friends \"friends\" because they are only your \"associates\" but you still call your enemies \"enemies\"! What a world when your enemies have to be kept closer than your \"friends\"! And what a world when even your brother can betray you!\"Part II\" is a much darker film in its content because it plunges us in a world where there's no room for genuine and non-calculating people –after all, isn't one of the many things that make the first film more enjoyable the presence of such characters as Sonny- Even Michael has these words about Fredo, \"he's a good heart but he's weak and stupid, and this is life and death\". Life and death indeed, the family expanded its power, becoming one of the wealthiest in Nevada, but it's not New York City anymore, it's time to deal with a new category of enemies, more dangerous because they are more respectable. The film opens with a conversation between Michael Corleone and Senator Geary, but this time the politician is not the criminal's friend, he not only despises him but explicitly affirms his intention to \"squeeze him\".Michael's reply sets the tone of the film \"Senator, my offer is this: nothing\", he wouldn't feign legitimacy with a man who just asserted his moral corruption. If politicians and criminals play in the same arena: business, then they'll play according to the rule of the strongest. Crime has ceased to be an underworld, on the contrary, it embraced the world, getting \"bigger than US Steel\" as Hyman Roth would say, in the name of making a profit that would go as far for legitimacy as pretending to serve a country's economy, Las Vegas, pre-Revolution Cuba, even be able to elect a new President. If Coppola was accused of romanticizing the mob in the first opus, no one can hold the same accusation against \"Part II\", and the directing plays a significant role to that.Indeed, it's impossible to end the second film with the same level of fascination created by the magical moment where Neri shuts the door on Kay's face, and maybe that's why we still enjoy the first film, because it has this sort of 'happy end' feel, because we are still within the Corleone's inner circle and \"the good team won\" and could savor the victory behind the closed door. Michael became another man, even more ruthless than his father, but he was the Don in this 'underworld' context, so he can only inspire our empathy, if not our respect.But in Part II, crime, business and politics are all part of the same hypocrisy, and while Michael could count on the loyalty of Neri, Rocco, Hagen and even Fredo at the end of the first part, in Part II, he becomes aware that greed and thirst for power can triumph over the most loyal individual.... and if he didn't knew that before, the assassination attempt he miraculously escaped from, sent a clear message about it. So, while \"Part I\" established the necessity of a strong loyalty to overcome a clearly identifiable enemy, \"Part I\"I highlights the illusory aspect of loyalty when it comes to an invisible enemy that can be on your own side, even your own brother, consequently leading to Michael's descent into paranoia.The first film was a consolidation of power, built on Family, friendship and loyalty, incarnated by the warmth and quiet strength of Vito Corleone, we find him again with the traits of Robert De Niro, in his Oscar-winning role. He represents the heritage of Michael Corleone, the proper use of power, of intelligence, of heart but the tragedy of \"Part II\" is to highlight the obsolescence of a figure like Vito Corleone in a world that got more blinded by greed and power, a world where Machiavellian intelligence was a more valuable asset than pure intuition and where even love and brotherhood could be reduced to sheer abstractions. Times have changed and Michael realized that the time of his father is over, and that he can indeed \"lose his family\". The tragic irony is that he lost it by trying to preserve it.The second film deconstructed all the values that its glorious predecessor stood for to draw a dark, gripping and harrowing portrait of Crime, incarnated by the cold and ruthless eyes of Michael Corleone, Al Pacino in what I believe to be one of the all-time greatest performances. It's thought-provoking, it's even more realistic, but maybe we blame it for not being 'more enjoyable' than the first film, more romantic I mean. For me, it's perfect the way it is.",

The two films together can thus be seen as representing the passing of a torch from the best actor of one generation to two of the best of the next. And it's amazing to see how fully the two youngsters come to inhabit their roles, and how fresh their portrayals are. The chronology of the story means they share no screen time; but when they eventually did come together on celluloid, over twenty years later in Michael Mann's 'Heat', they appeared as clapped-out, over-acting, stereotypes of themselves - whereas here they simply play their parts, to perfection. Pacino especially is good (while de Nero attempts to impersonate Brando); while among the supporting cast John Cazale (who also co-starred with Pacino in 'Dog Day Afternoon') is also exceptional . The film shares other virtues with its predecessor: a stately pace, but masterful directing ensuring that the film never bores; and a great, haunting score. However, I don't quite find this film the equal of its predecessor: it lacks a bit of focus in comparison. The two stories (of the Godfather's early years, and his son's later ones), do not fit seamlessly and the second, major story is too political, lacking the visceral impact of the story told in 'The Godfather Part One'; while the other story is simpler, but almost not political enough. A third story, maybe more interesting (how the Corleones got rich, presumably under prohibition) is not covered at all. In summary, for all the plaudits given to this film, I don't feel it adds that much to its predecessor; but it's still a film of the highest quality, and another reminder (if needed) of quite how good an actor the young Pacino was.",

        "text": "Making a sequel that can manage to live up to the expectations of the original is an achievement in itself. But when the original film is being universally hailed as the greatest motion picture ever made, measuring up to that same feat is undeniably a near impossible task. But then, that's exactly what The Godfather Part II manages to accomplish by building upon the original in ways most sequels never dare to and is possibly the only film in existence that has the calibre to challenge the reputation of The Godfather. Boasting all the ingredients that made its predecessor one of world cinema's greatest triumphs, The Godfather Part II remains one of the most critically & artistically successful films in cinema history and amongst all sequels, is certainly the most honoured.The Godfather Part II tells the story of two generations of the Corleone family, thus serving as both a sequel & a prequel to the original, transitioning within the same film. The prequel portion is illustrated in a series of flashbacks and depicts the life of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in the previous film & by Robert De Niro in this one) and shows his rise from a poor immigrant in 1910s New York to the highly powerful & respected boss of the Corleone crime family. The sequel portion deals with the aftermath of the events of the first film and continues the journey of Michael Corleone as the new Don and shows him tightening his grip on his family business and expanding it into Vegas & Cuba. The two parallel dramas within the same film also serve as antonyms to each other, considering that one part follows Vito Corleone's rise to power through love, fear & respect while the other part represents the fall of Michael Corleone from the ruthless boss of a vast empire to a lonely & empty shell of a human being.Continuing the saga from where it signed off in the previous part, Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo, this time, bring the origin & evolution of the Corleone crime family on-screen through flashbacks but also carry forward its current legacy in the sequel segment of the story. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is much improved than it was in The Godfather and presents him in complete control of all filmmaking aspects. The screenplay is expertly written by Coppola & Mario Puzo, adapting the prequel part from the novel while envisioning the sequel part from scratch and, just like the previous film, contains some of the most memorable quotes in movie history. Cinematography inherits the same Technicolor print from the original and adds different contrasts to distinguish the two parallel timelines occurring within the film. Editing is equally impressive for it balances the two stories beautifully and keeps the pace in check throughout its 200 minutes of runtime. Art Direction & Set Decoration shows major enhancements over its predecessor. And finally, the music by Nino Rota is even better, building upon the iconic score of The Godfather and exploring newer territories in this one.One of this saga's biggest strength has been its remarkable cast & splendid performances. The Godfather Part II features Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton & Talia Shire in their reprising roles while also adding Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo & others to its strong ensemble. Al Pacino has given many spectacular performances in his film career but his work in this film remains his best. The cold & ruthless Michael Corleone, played exceptionally well by Al Pacino, returns to screen as more evolved & unforgiving and this performance of Pacino easily ranks among the finest that cinema has to offer. Robert De Niro comes next with an equally magical performance as young Vito Corleone and brilliantly modified his voice & expressions to match the attributes that Marlon Brando brought to this character in the previous film. John Cazale gets more screen time and delivers a heartbreaking performance as Fredo Corleone. Lee Strasberg & Michael V. Gazzo also chip in with strong inputs as Hyman Roth & Frank Pentangeli, respectively. And other impressive contributions come from Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams-Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, & Gastone Moschin as Don Fanucci.On an overall scale, everything about this sequel just works. It is more star-studded than the first film and all the filmmaking methods introduced in The Godfather appear seamlessly evolved in this second part. Fans will always be divided over which is a superior film but there is no denying that both movies are paramount examples of flawless filmmaking. As for the two stories that are masterfully intertwined within this film, I personally prefer the flashback segment more than Michael's tale for it was much better filmed, more captivating & also added quite an amount of artistic touch to the whole narrative, comparatively. From start to finish, this masterpiece improves upon the original in such impressive ways that not only it succeeds as a successful follow-up to its predecessor but also shares the same class of greatness with it and both films, since their inception, have been highly instrumental in influencing its genre as well as cinema aesthetics. Displaying greatness in all aspects of filmmaking, The Godfather Part II is an ingenious work of expert artistry in both front & behind the camera and serves wonderfully as an epic conclusion to the violent history of the Corleone crime family. Certainly the greatest & most respected sequel of all time and one of the greatest treasures of world cinema, The Godfather Part II comes one hundred percent recommended.",

        "text": "I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip.",

        "text": "I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",

        "text": "Following on from BATMAN BEGINS comes Christopher Nolan's second entry in the revitalised Batman film series. I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie and looked forward to this one, aware that many principal cast members were returning. Add to this all the fuss surrounding Heath Ledger's untimely demise and his supposedly terrifying performance as the Joker, and I walked into the cinema ready for a great time. I wasn't disappointed.This is Hollywood blockbuster film-making at its finest: intelligent, well-scripted, with great effects, acting and choreography. This is a powerful, brooding film, even darker than its predecessor, that packs a whole lotta violence into a 12a certificate movie. Okay, so this film ain't gory, but it's certainly one of the most violent and disturbing flicks I've seen in a while. A lot of that is down to Ledger's performance, which has rightly been called brilliant. Blowing memories of Jack Nicholson out of the water, Ledger is a virtuoso in the role, a real freak of nature, a repulsive killer stealing every scene. It's the best performance this actor ever gave, and it's a shame he died when he was just realising his true potential as an actor and not as a wooden pretty boy.The film kicks off with action and follows it with more action. Car chases, fantastic technology (the sonar stuff breaks new boundaries), some martial arts fights and the biggest and best explosion seen on film...they're all here and they never let up. The bone-breaking blows that Batman rains down on the villains are incredibly powerful and I still can't work out how this achieved a kiddie-friendly rating. The script has plenty of twists and turns, including the deaths of some notable leading characters, and plenty of characterisation as well. Themes of good and evil and what it means to be a hero are explored well and the actors all do their roles justice. Special mention goes to Aaron Eckhart, an actor who I've previously found bland but who's excellent as DA Harvey Dent here.If I had any complaints, it would be that Bale hardly gets a look in as Batman takes a back seat to the villains on display. But when they're so good, who cares? Old-timers Caine and Freeman add sparkle, humour and warmth to their parts and there are lots of laughs along the way to go with the shocks and chills. I found Gyllenhaal to be a lacklustre replacement for Katie Holmes, but she's barely around so that doesn't matter. Special effects are top-notch, with one make-up/CGI job surpassing Arnie's ruined face in TERMINATOR 3. So THE DARK KNIGHT is a fantastic film – dark, bleak and uncompromising. It may be a little too much for some viewers, but I loved every second of it – and I look forward to watching it again. A great film.",

        "text": "Dark Knight, The (2008) **** (out of 4) I'll be honest and admit that I'm not much of a fan of the so called \"comic book\" movies out there. I'll also be honest and admit that I didn't care for the previous series of Batman movies from Burton and Schumacher. Batman Begins on the other hand was a different story as it found it to be incredibly good but a rare occasion as occurred as this sequel is even better. I've always felt that comic book movies didn't contain enough elements of a dark nature nor did they contain very much adult-themed stuff but that's certainly not the case here as this movie contains enough character development and moral questions for three movies. The epic nature of this movie makes it a one of a kind even though I think the 151-minute running time is the only fault in the film. It's rather amazing at how dark this movie is yet movie crowds ate it up but perhaps they ate so much of it up simply because of how dark it is. This film works on so many levels but I think the biggest are its screenplay and actors. The darkness of the story is perfectly brought to the screen by Nolan with his masterful direction, which paints the perfect picture of corruption, greed and moral responsibility. All of the characters from The Joker to Harvey Dent to even Batman must face various moral issues and this type of stuff not only makes for great drama but it brings a lot of depth to this \"comic book\" movie. The performances are all quite remarkable and that includes the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Before seeing the film I kept asking myself if his performance could top that of Jack Nicholson but I think that question shouldn't even be asked as both performances are so completely different that you can't compare them. Ledger certainly steals the show and leaves the viewer with goose bumps each time he's on the screen. It really seems as if he just floats through each scene as if he were a ghost roaming around. The walk that Ledger brings to the character is so refreshing and original that I couldn't take my eyes off of him. That wonderful talk and the brilliant line giving just adds to the fun and was it ever great to see such a dark villain. Christian Bale is also once again very good in the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Again, the screenplay benefits Bale greatly by having him just as dark as the villains. Aaron Eckhart is getting overshadowed by Ledger but he too really deserves a lot of credit as he probably gives the best performance of anyone dealing with the moral issues. His stint as Dent is perfect for a hero and his turn as Two-Face is perfect for a villain. Maggie Gyllenhaal also does a good job in the love interests role as does Michael Caine, Eric Roberts and Morgan Freeman. Gary Oldman also shines in his role of Gordon. What makes the special effects so great is that the movie isn't in their hand as far as entertainment goes. Yes, the effects and chase sequences look great but they work even better because the screenplay gives us characters to care about. I won't go as far as to call this one of the greatest films ever made but I do think it has to change the way comic book movies are made.",

        "text": "Batman has proved successful in cleaning up the streets and a fresh new DA, Harvey Dent, is keen to clean up the mobsters in one big conspiracy case. Naturally an unpopular move, particularly with the psychotic villain known as \"The Joker\", who makes it his mission to unveil the identity of the Batman, before killing him. The Joker begins his reign of terror, forcing the citizens of Gotham to wonder whether or not it was worth having a Batman if this is the sort of chaos that his presence unleashes. With the stakes raised higher than ever, Bruce Wayne struggles to hold onto his moral code in the face of villain whose only aim is to unleash chaos and panic across the city.I waited a few weeks for all the hype to die down, but I was looking forward to seeing this film because Batman Begins had done a great job of repairing a character and franchise that was in tatters as Schumacher's gaudy and unlikeable Happy Meal-selling film had finished with it. I was hoping for more of the same as The Dark Knight did not disappoint as the tone continues to be dark and as realistic as a film can be when it is about a man dressed as a bat. The film is a summer blockbuster but yet it manages to at least get close to a really engaging and interesting plot  this is a joyful far cry from The Fantastic Four and the like, this feels like a film that is marketed to me, not my children. As such the plot does offer some good moralising and conflicts that are what I expected from the damaged \"hero\" of Batman and the freaks he is up against. Again, it is not a \"proper\" drama but these elements are effective within the bigger picture and they only help draw the viewer into the story and characters.The fact that it does engage also means that the action is much more effective. I watched Wanted the other night where everything was so simplistic and dumb that I never cared and the action was only effects. Here the tone is deadly serious and the action feels urgent and dangerous. This has produced the problem in the UK over the rating and I do think that it should have been a 15, although I can understand why it got a 12A. Problem for the certification body is that the film doesn't contain much in the way of graphic acts but it is the tone that is so very harsh and dark, thus making it feel much more violent than it actually is. For me this is not a problem as the film is not for children and I am not a child, but I can sort of see why The Daily Mail jumped on it as the destruction of the mankind or whatever they said it was going to do to our children. I do like the dark tone though and it is not just a visual thing or something in a specific few scenes but rather woven through the whole film. It starts with the characters and performances and of course comes across in the direction and cinematography, which is suitably dark and Gothic without being camp or unrealistic.The cast do good work but all are in the shadow of Ledger  not because it is fashionable to praise him but because his is a great turn and makes the film. I do feel sorry for Jack Nicholson because his Joker now looks like a childishly simple creation that is a bit of cheesy fun but no more. With Ledger we genuinely feel unnerved with him on the screen, his clothes and make-up being all part of this unhinged creation with his ticks and hair-trigger air; his performance is part of the film working as well as it does as he sells the character and the material. If he does get an Oscar nod, it will not (just) be for sympathy, but because he genuinely is that good. Bale finds himself a supporting player in his own film but deals with it well; not sure about his laughably gruff voice as Batman though  it just distracts. Eckhart is a good bit of casting because he normally plays morally dubious characters, so the contrast works at the start and he can work with the later stages. Gyllenhaal has her critics but she is much better than Holmes and stands up well with the all-male cast. The supporting cast offer the usual quality in Oldman, Caine and Freeman as well as other faces in minor roles such as Roberts, a returning Murphy, Carbonell, McFarlane, White, Fichtner, Lister and others.The Dark Knight is a great film. The dark tone, good plotting, strong characters, performances and overall design and delivery all make for a grown-up blockbuster that is heads and shoulders above its peers. Ledger is impressive and drives the film forward in an adult and engaging way. Parents with the legal ability to take their four year olds should think twice, because this is not a kiddie blockbuster, but for everyone else there is a great deal to enjoy here.",

        "text": "So it finally happened, a DC Comics movie adaptation that out-marveled the Marvel folks, and to such a degree that it might be quite a while before anything comes close to topping \"The Dark Knight\". This was the severely grim and gritty version of the Batman, ushered in by Frank Miller's initial treatment in the landmark graphic novel \"The Dark Knight Returns\" in 1986. Miller's portrayal of the iconic super hero took the gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes. The movie explores this theme at many levels, and would have served up enough of a plot to keep this viewer interested even without the explosions, chases and general mayhem that modern day audiences need to get their fix on. Actually, the Joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down from one of Batman's cables over the streets of Gotham, as noted in my summary line above. In the comic book world, they HAVE been fighting each other forever, or as long as forever exists since the creation of Batman back in 1939; the Joker came on the scene in 1940 in the comic, Batman #1.I don't think this could have been the same picture without Heath Ledger in the role of Batman's all time greatest nemesis. His portrayal blows away Jack Nicholson's performance in 1989's \"Batman\", and that's through no fault of Nicholson's. Today's films are a product of harsher and deadlier times, and it's striking that Ledger's characterization would define the Joker as an extremist, perhaps even a terrorist. More than once I found myself questioning what was going on during the opening bank robbery scene. The bad guys were offing each other based on instructions delivered by the Joker, and you suddenly come to the realization that this domino game had to end with one man standing. It's how we're introduced to Ledger's definitive Joker, a performance that won't be topped.Another thought came to me as I watched the story unfold, and that was how similar the coin toss gimmick paralleled the one in \"No Country For Old Men\". Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) began using the tactic following the death of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and I began picturing Javier Bardem in the role of The Joker. Hard to imagine who might have been the more evil character, Bardem's Anton Chigurh in a more realistic setting, or The Joker in a fictional Gotham City. Fortunately, not a choice one would normally have to consider.I'm a little bit on the fence as to Christian Bale's portrayal of The Batman. He's more than adequate as Bruce Wayne, but the voice he gives to the Dark Knight seems a bit melodramatic. Granted, he couldn't use the same voice as his alter ego, but there were times that it sounded so forced as to come across as parody, and other times just goofy, almost a throwback to the Adam West days of the TV Batman. Strange, but have you considered that no one ever calls him the Caped Crusader anymore either?All in all, great performances all around. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the new Commissioner Gordon was excellent, while Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox were solid even with limited screen time. I thought about Katie Holmes just once while making a mental comparison when Maggie Gyllenhaal first appeared on screen. Truthfully, they looked similar enough to effect the transition smoothly to the point where it wasn't distracting for me in the least.Obviously, the set up for the next sequel was firmly set in place with the creation of Two Face, the now alter ego of District Attorney Harvey Dent. The rendering of Dent's burned face was boldly executed and quite marvelous in it's own grotesque way. I'll be looking forward to the next installment.And NOW, for a personal rant. I probably should put this in parentheses because it doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but for this picture to be #1 on the IMDb list of all time best movies after 4 days of release is incomprehensible, if not downright laughable (and I did rate it a 10 myself). I think there should be a moratorium of at least a couple of years before a film qualifies for IMDb ranking, giving the dust some time to settle from all the grand opening hoopla that surrounds a picture like this. I feel the same way about other recent movies like \"No Country For Old Men\" and \"There Will Be Blood\", both of which garnered numerous awards and fan approval. But if they're to be considered among the best films of all time, they'll be considered that way a decade from now without the need for multiple votes from over zealous fan boys.",

        "text": "Continuing on from \"Batman Begins\", Christopher Nolan has now given us \"The Dark Knight\", an equally brilliant achievement. Here we have the Caped Crusader (Christian Bale) battling The Joker (Heath Ledger in a blood-chilling final performance), while also trying to navigate the cesspool of crime and corruption that pervades Gotham City.I will say that I found the movie a little silly whenever Batman converses with someone. But what really impressed me was Harvey Dent's (Aaron Eckhart) role. As Gotham's hotshot DA, he represents hope for wiping out all crime; Batman is mostly known as a vigilante. And he can only be known as such, because...well, I'll let you find out what it means.You may have heard that this is a dark movie. Especially The Joker. Whereas Jack Nicholson's Joker was basically a live action Bugs Bunny, Heath Ledger's Joker is a maniacal, ruthless, vicious thug; he seeks only the creation, promotion and dissemination of pure chaos. And there are some REALLY intense scenes throughout the movie; not necessarily violent, but definitely not for the fainthearted.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this one. While I could predict some of what was going to happen, much of it surprised me. It will probably surprise you too. Also starring Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and small appearances by Cillian Murphy and Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy.",

        "text": "After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).There's little use in writing a review of \"The Dark Knight\" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The \"Bat-Sonar\" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Prestige\"). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his \"A\" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre.",

        "text": "The first film in the re-imagining of the series was a big hit, but this sequel was a global success, especially with the superb performance by the star of Brokeback Mountain who tragically died from a (prescribed) drugs overdose shortly after filming had finished, from director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia). Basically a criminal terrorist and mastermind calling himself the Joker (posthumous Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Heath Ledger) robs the bank run by the mob, and to take on the Mafia district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) becomes the new face for justice and hope in Gotham City, with the help of Batman aka Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and Lieutenant James 'Jim' Gordon (Gary Oldman). Mob bosses Sal Maroni (Eric Roberts), Gambol (Michael Jai White) and the Chechen (Ritchie Coaster), who have had Chinese accountant Lau (Chin Han) hide their funds, are confronted by the Joker because he wants to kill the, but they all refuse to help, putting a bounty on him. The Joker kills Gambol, and his gang go under his control, and meanwhile Batman, with new technology supplied by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), has found and returned Lau to Gotham to testify in a court case to help bring down the gangsters. The Joker puts his plan into action by threatening the city, if the Dark Knight does not reveal his true identity he will kill people, and soon enough he starts killing the people involved in the mob boss court cases, including Commissioner Loeb (The Fast Show's Colin McFarlane) and Judge Surrillo (Nydia Rodriguez Terracina), and Dent may be next. Dent is hidden, and Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who has been dating Dent is being looked after by Bruce's faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth (Sir Michael Caine), but the Joker appears to kill Gordon, who sacrifices himself to save the Mayor (Nestor Carbonell), and when Bruce plans to reveal his identity to the press Dent claims he is the Batman. This means that the district attorney is taken into protective custody, but the Joker catches up and tries to kill him, but Batman inside his armoured car and then on his motorcycle is on their tail, and Gordon who faked his death catches the criminals, and gets promoted to Commissioner. Batman demands to know from the clown prince of crime where Dent and Rachel are, as they have disappeared, and eventually, after some beating, he reveals that they are both in separate buildings full of explosives, Batman planned to find Rachel, but he instead gets to Dent, so Rachel is blown up and dies, while Dent is taken out, but petrol on half his face ignites when the explosion happens. Using documents, Wayne Enterprises accountant Mike Engel (Anthony Michael Hall) has concluded that Bruce Wayne is Batman, so he plans blackmail, and meanwhile the Joker has escaped prison and kills Lau and the Chechen, and he threatens to bomb a hospital if Reese isn't killed. While the accountant is rescued by Gordon, the Joker visits Dent in hospital, who has become scarred on half his face and donned the persona of Two-Face, he tells him that the mob is responsible for the death of Rachel and convinces him to get revenge, on a coin flip decision. Gotham General Hospital was blown up, while Two-Face manages to find and kill Maroni and two corrupt cops who helped kidnap Rachel, and the Joker has rigged two ships, one carrying civilian passengers and the other Arkham Asylum inmates, with explosives, and both sets of people have the trigger for the opposite ship, with the demand to blow up the other ship before midnight, or both be exploded. With the help of Fox and a computer as a citywide tracking device, they manage to find where the Joker is, in a building, where hostages are wearing clown masks to look like criminals to the SWAT, but they are saved, both ships refuse to blow up each other, and the Joker despite being caught boasts that he has won when Dent's rampage will be revealed. Gordon is lured to the building where Rachel died where his wife and children are being held hostage, and Dent is threatening their lives from the flip of his coin, and after being shot while wearing body armour Batman tackles Dent, causing him to fall from the top of the building to the ground, and saving Gordon's son. So that Dent will remain a symbol of hope for Gotham City, Batman wants to take responsibility for the deaths of the people Dent murdered, Gordon is upset but is forced to agree, so he orders a manhunt for Batman, while Alfred spares Bruce anymore heartache by burning a letter that Rachel wrote announcing her engagement to Harvey, and Fox sees the tracking computer self-destruct. Also starring Monique Gabriela Curnen as Ramirez, Ron Dean as Wuertz, Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow aka Dr. Jonathan Crane, William Fichtner as Bank Manager and The Fifth Element's Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as Tattooed Prisoner. Bale is still fantastic as the silly playboy and the rough and ready dark hero, Ledger is fascinating as the psychopathic and intelligent scar-faced villain (the licking of lips is a great psycho touch), Eckhart is alright as the slowly maddened political figure turned Two-Face, and the other cast members are good too. Just with the previous film the story is much more grown up and sophisticated compared to the previous incarnations, the make-up is good, and of course the explosions and special effects used create many more exciting chase and fight sequences, a cool and entertaining action fantasy. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up & Hair, Best Music for Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects.

You have never seen so many vehicles, large and small, racing through the gloomy and deserted urban streets. And every one of them seems to crash and turn into an exploding fireball emitting shards of glass and flaps of unidentifiable metal.The business is taken seriously too. The blows rained upon the victims seem to hurt. The occasional wisecracks from The Joker don't begin to make up for the realistic pain.It all makes me wonder if our peculiar civilization hasn't entered the decadent period that precedes its fall from dominance.

        "text": "This was extremely entertaining all the way through, which is quite a statement for a film that is two-and-a-half hours long. There are absolutely no dry spots in this fascinating film. Does everything make sense? Of course not; there are a lot of holes in the story, but it's a superhero action film and it's not meant to be dissected for credibility. It's just supposed to entertain, and that it does.A large part of the credit for that goes to Heath Ledger for his \"The Joker\" portrayal. Every scene in which Ledger appeared was riveting. His speech, mannerisms and his dialog were fantastic. For the latter, I have to commend the screen writers who gave Ledger some great lines!Actually, he and Aaron Eckert, who played \"Harvey 'Two Face' Dent,\" were most of the show, character-wise. Maggie Gyllenhaal was good, too, as \"Rachel Dawes,\" the woman of both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent's affections. Otherwise, the familiar good guys - Christopher Bale as \"Batman,\" Michael Caine as \"Alfred,\" Gary Oldman as Inspector/Commishoner Gordan\" and Morgan Freeman as \"Lucius Fox\" were okay but all more interesting in the previous film, \"Batman Begins.\" Speaking of Fox, his high-and-mighty attitude toward Wayne's surveillance system was disappointing to hear. I had thought he had trust in Bruce Wayne. Also, I was sorry to hear the language deteriorate in the final half hour with some unneeded profanity by some inconsequential character.Overall, however, this latest Batman movie ranks among the best of any I've seen, at least on the first viewing. I'm looking forward to watching it again when the Blu-Ray disc comes out next month. This is a great film to enjoy visually and audibly with some fantastic action scenes and excellent dialog.I had heard that Batman was a \"dark\" and almost unlikable figure, himself, in this film but I did not find that. Hey, he did what he had to do to stop a maniacal killer (which \"Fox\" didn't understand., nor some of the other main characters.) For a guy who has provided nothing but good deeds for the fickle citizens of Gotham over the years, this hero certainly doesn't appear to be appreciated......except by his fans of comics and film.In fact, that's the only main thing I would dispute with the writers of this movie: their conclusion at the end that Batman is \"not a hero, but a dark knight.\" No, I would say someone who continually risks his life to save others is quite a hero!",

        "text": "This, the second of director Cristopher Nolan's Batman trilogy opens with a bank robbery; the robbers are all wearing clown masks and when each has finished his part of the job he is killed by one of his colleagues. When only one is left he removes his mask to reveal a disturbing face; he is wearing predominantly white make up with black around his eyes and a disturbing red smile he is The Joker and clearly he is insane. It turns out the money he stole belonged to the mob and they are worried about losing the rest; either to The Joker or to the forces of law and order. Leading the campaign against crime in Gotham is a new white knight; DA Harvey Dent; a man who intends to take down the criminals by using the system rather than hiding behind a mask. Soon Dent, Lt. Gordon and Batman are after The Joker; and he in turn is after them and those they love.I put off watching this for a long time fearing I'd be disappointed; surely no film could live up to the hype this one received It turned out I needn't have worried; this is a fantastic film. The returning cast members perform well but it is the new characters that really stand out. Heath Ledger certainly deserved his Oscar; his Joker is genuinely disturbing, Aaron Eckhart is great too in the roll of Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhaal shines as his girlfriend, and Bruce Wayne's old friend Rachel. Those wanting action will be pleased as it rarely stops and is spectacular; this doesn't mean there is any sacrifice of good characterisation and plot though. There are some good surprises along the way as well as a degree of tragedy. If you think superhero films are for children you should be aware that there are plenty of disturbing and even brutal moments here which might disturb youngsters I was a little surprised that it got a UK '12' certificate; it is certainly a 'high 12'. Overall I'd say don't worry about the hype just sit back and enjoy an excellent action film that just happens to have a superhero as its main character.",

Well because I am not much fan of superhero movies or comic book heroes who ventured to the big screen. However, having seen all the older Batman movies, I will say that with \"The Dark Knight\", then Christopher Nolan have really put the previous Batman movies to shame.And with good reason.The storyline in \"The Dark Knight\" is for a more mature audience, and it appeals to an audience capable of coherent thought, unlike the pseudo-comical older Batman movies.And with an impressive list of talent on the cast list, then \"The Dark Knight\" really does impress. However, I remember the hype about Heath Ledger's death and his performance of the Joker in this movie. With the risk of offending a great number of people here, then I don't really get that hype. His performance was good, sure, but it was a bit hyped up by the media. Jack Nicholson did a good enough job with his interpretation of the Joker back in the day, but he didn't get this much hype.Moving on, \"The Dark Knight\" offers a good storyline, spiced up with nifty action sequences, and of course a lot of bat utilities - as always.\"The Dark Knight\" was a major step upwards from \"Batman Begins\", and I must admit that this movie have sparked an interest in actually sitting down to watch \"The Dark Knight Rises\" as well.",

The Dark Knight is undeniably visually impressive, full of flashy special effects, stunning production design and spectacular action set-pieces, but the fans who have rated this film so highly clearly have as little grip on reality as its antagonist The Joker (Heath Ledger).152 minutes of relentlessly dark, dreary, depressing drama—the enjoyment factor turned down to the lowest possible setting—this overly complex and frequently logic-free sequel to Batman Begins sees director Christopher Nolan once again presenting the antics of a man dressed as a bat in a completely humourless fashion. And if Nolan is going to take matters so seriously, then so am I...Could a man with half his face burned off really get out of bed the next day to conduct a vendetta? Why does Batman talk to Fox in his 'gruff' voice when the man already knows his real identity? How do you get hundreds of barrels of explosives onto two ferries without being noticed? Likewise, how did The Joker wire up a hospital to blow-up without being spotted? Who built Batman's underground silo? Does anyone really know what the hell was going on during that scene with that cell phone sonar equipment and the building full of baddies? Where exactly do you hire a butler who can arrange for a skyhook in Hong Kong? These are just a few of the many questions that arise from Nolan's so-called masterpiece.Rabid Batman/Nolan fans might be all too happy to overlook these somewhat awkward posers, but I can't—not when such a blatantly flawed film currently sits at No.8 in the IMDb top 250.5.5 out of 10, but not good enough to be rounded up to a 6.",

In director Christopher Nolan's follow-up to his 2005 blockbuster \"Batman Begins\", Gotham is just another Metropolitan city full of embittered residents squirming under the stronghold of Mafiosos, psychopaths, blackmailers, and terrorists--namely the Joker, who opens the film robbing a bank owned by the Mob with his masked cohorts, whom he has no loyalty to. Heath Ledger won a posthumous Supporting Actor Oscar for his twisted portrayal of the Joker--playing the facially-scarred criminal mastermind as if he just escaped from a lunatic asylum--but it isn't a multi-layered, pleasurable performance. Christian Bale returns as billionaire Bruce Wayne (and his alter-ego, a flesh-and-blood Batman), putting his trust in Gotham's latest hotshot District Attorney who is dating Wayne's childhood sweetheart and going after the Mafia in court, if the Joker doesn't get to them first. Nolan stages an extended, fiery vehicle chase that is absolutely astounding, yet the rest of his film falls a bit short. The performances are variable, the mood is dour and depressing, and the illogical plot tied in endless, headache-inducing knots. Fans of the Superhero genre will no doubt revel in the sleek look of the picture, but the script (penned by director Nolan and his brother Jonathan) is a disappointment, not helped by the smash-and-grab editing which cuts off and mixes up sequences before the drama has even played out. **1/2 from ****",

This second installment is better in many ways, but for me doesn't quite have the charm of the first.Christian Bale of course is back as Bruce Wayne and Batman. But his childhood sweetheart and now District Attorney lawyer is Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. She does a fine job but is a definite step down from Katie Holmes.Most of the buzz has been, especially after his untimely death, Heath Ledger as The Joker. This Joker is quite different from the character Jack Nicholson played in the 1989 version, more sinister and more dangerous. He doesn't have any grand plan, he just enjoys wreaking havoc, and his mission here is to kill innocent people and cause destruction until he succeeds in having Batman's identity revealed. Ledger is chillingly good in this role.Aaron Eckhart is introduced as Harvey Dent who, after getting caught up in an explosion, becomes Two-Face. Michael Caine is back as Bruce Wayne's butler and father figure, Alfred Pennyworth, and plays the role just perfectly. As well as Gary Oldman, back as cop James Gordon. And Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, now head of the Wayne corporation and Bruce's personal scientific consultant.The new crime boss is Eric Roberts as Salvatore Maroni, and he is superb in the role.

        "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect from The Dark Knight a sequel to Batman Begins and, by virtue of extended franchise, a remake of the Tim Burton 1989 Batman movie, which also featured Batman, the Joker, and Harvey Dent (though not Two-Face). The previews had all the action and excitement, and some cool-looking gadgets, but... despite the whole \"Heath Ledger is dead, this is final great performance\" hype, I didn't want to second guess myself. A Joker with no real \"origin\" story? Ledger playing him with slapped on, sloppy make-up and lots of facial tics? How will this work, and how could it be any better than Nicholson's Joker? Answers? It does work, very well, though it's dependent on the universe that director Christopher Nolan has set in place. Ledger's Joker wouldn't work in Burton's style, as his mix of camp and seriousness was perfect for an actor like Nicholson. But in Nolan's world, he fits in like a f***ing psychotic glove. To get it out of the way for this review, I'll say this: Ledger practically lives up to the hype. His presence is uncouth and strange, and not like one's used to (the slashes through his face are \"jokingly\" referenced that \"my dad did this, \"my wife did this\"), and he's totally ambiguous. But it's also the unpredictable Joker seen yet on screen, and only topped probably in the craziest of the comics. He's an unpredictable force that is the twisted ying to Batman's protect-by-all-means-but-murder yang. It's basically an anarchic punk rocker taken to the lengths of a terrorist.While this should make the Joker boring, there's nothing that Nolan isn't willing to do to make the audience jump or second guess the plot, which makes it extra exciting as he heads on in the last half hour, leading to an incredible double-catharsis of sorts. But if Ledger's performance is being touted for an posthumous Oscar nomination (which I'm still not sure about though will probably happen), then the amount of attention being paid to Aaron Eckhardt is minuscule in comparison. On his own terms, Eckhart delivers a performance that's even better than Ledger's (or, rather, he has a lot more complexity than \"I'm gonna blow stuff up and go chaotic here\"). He puts in everything that's needed for the perfect Harvey Dent, as a man who's the \"white knight\", someone who could be the one to take the place of Batman as the one to look after Gotham. His downfall, however, becomes the great, horrifying tragedy of this Batman. To say Eckhart blows all other interpretations (on film or TV) of Dent is putting it lightly, and the make-up given to his latter reincarnation is some of the best I've ever seen.In the interest of not coming off like a total crazy fan-boy for the Dark Knight, there are some likely criticisms to have. Despite Nolan's vision being epic and grand, and for the most part pulling off such a big story very well, the last section, however exciting and tense and posing moral questions, goes a little long. And, however staying true to the comics (which is great), the last section starts to pile on the exposition a bit much. But these are mostly mild quibbles. In the scope of delving into the Batman world as honestly (if not realistically) as possible, Nolan succeeds even further than in 'Begins'. The characters of Batman/Wayne, Gordon, Dent, and Rachel Dawson are all put into incredible circumstances throughout the film, and we're pulling for them and care about what happens all the way. It's all the more a credit to the storytelling power since we should know how things will turn out; a certain twist mid-way through had me thinking \"say it isn't so\", and when I knew I was had, I knew Nolan had done his job well.Another question: does Dark Knight live up to the hype? It depends on how you define it and how it pertains to the movie. A lot of the hype has been around Ledger's death, and the new characters, and some of the hype (i.e. box-office predictions) have become ludicrous. Yet, for what Nolan set out to do as filmmaker, delivering drama and action and pathos and a kick-ass-but-truly-conflicted Batman in his *very* dark city of Gotham, he succeeded admirably. It might not be the same amount of pure \"fun\" of Burton's films, but then again it doesn't need to be. It's an excellent, breathtaking experience, and one of the best pics of 08.",

        "text": "Before I comment on the movie proper, I'd like to mention two things: One, the person I went with-who works at this particular theatre and saw the midnight premiere-thought the bank manager role was played by Jimmy Smits but I immediately recognized him as William Fichtner from \"Invasion\", the TV series he did with Eddie Cibrian. Also, when the Joker was threatening Rachel Dawes, it was the only time I was taken out of the picture since I said aloud that he was threatening Jake Gyllenhaal's sister with my friend mentioning her name since we both saw Heath Ledger and Jake in Brokeback Moutain a few years ago. Ledger is fine as the main villain though I stop at saying he's better than Jack Nicholson in the role or deserves an Oscar nomination though it would be fine if he did. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement from Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's former girlfriend though I remember liking Holmes fine too. And Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Dawes' new beau, is also fine with his initial role as \"white knight\" district attorney later turning into what would become known as Two-Face. And I loved having Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler having a previous background in the battling jungles of Burma so he can tell his master of his dilemma there. Throw in Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox and you've almost got a perfect movie. Certainly, Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader is even better here than in Batman Begins and he is to me, like many viewers, The absolute Dark Knight here. While the movie may be longish in spots, Christopher Nolan lets it be that way so he can make us really care for the characters. I certainly was very touched by the sacrifices the new Commissoner Gordon, as played by Gary Oldman, had to make throughout the picture especially when he had to deal with Two-Face and his family's peril near the end. So the many who went to see this once and want to do it again, what are you waiting for? P.S. Having not recognized Anthony Micheal Hall previously, I'll have to look for him the next time I watch which may be soon too!",

        "text": "The film is good but is very much over-rated. The Daily News rated this movie *****. It is rather a *** as I shall try to explain.The acting is top-notch, especially Heath Ledger as the Joker and Aaron Eckhart, amazingly good as Harvey Dent, D.A.This is one film that is rare since good does not triumph over evil. Dent's transformation is magnificently realized. It just shows us what situations can lead someone so pious to go so wrong.The film is action packed. The special effects are marvelously arranged.As far as the Oscars for this year go, an argument can be made that Ledger's performance should be in the supporting category as well as Eckhart. Gary Oldham,as Gordon, should also be in the running for a supporting Oscar as well as Maggie Gyllenhaal, who has really shown a depth of maturity here in a breakout performance.My lone argument with this film is the last-half hour. Once the Gyllenhaal character is killed off, the film does go a bit down-hill. It becomes confusing at this point. Confusion we don't need as we wish to study the change in dimension depicted by Dent. That being said, the picture is one of a rare quality. A thin line is drawn between good and evil here and we wonder where we can go from here as the credits roll.",

        "text": "It's certainly no exaggeration to claim Heath Ledger entirely owns this film. He clearly lived for his role of The Joker, most likely died for it too, and he's undeniably the sole reason why \"The Dark Knight\" is currently considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made and even topping this website's very own top 250 ranking. But Heath Ledger deserves every single word of praise and honor that is being written about him. Ledger's passing irrevocably gives an extra and deeply tragic dimension to the new Batman movie, but even if the actor would still be alive today he would be the film's main attraction. With his performance as The Joker  a brilliant psychopath without cause or motives  Ledger exactly embodies what the ultimately relentless cinematic villain looks and acts like. Right from his first appearance on screen, when he illustrates an imaginative yet highly disturbing magic trick involving a pencil, Heath Legder already surpasses the performances of everyone who ever depicted the character of the Joker in the past and, yes, this even includes the almighty Jack Nicholson. The \"new\" Joker looks menacing, talks menacing, behaves menacing and  most unsettling of all  his vile acts are completely impulsive and unpredictable. The Joker's facial make-up looks grimmer than the expressionist paintings by Edvard Munch, the morbid anecdotes he narrates about his past will give you cold shivers and even his continuous smacking of the lips is downright petrifying. It is, simply put, one of the greatest and most mesmerizing performances ever given. Period.Of course, given the brilliance of Ledger's performance and the tragic event of his death before the film's release date, you sometimes can't escape the impression that the whole production relies and revolves entirely on him, and this shouldn't be the case with such as prestigious and eminent film like \"The Dark Knight\". The storyline is basically very thin and most of the time it feels as if Batman himself is actually just a supportive character in the giant Joker and Harvey Dent (stellar performance by Aaron Eckhart) two-men show. Christian Bale's performance is terrific as always, but the his opponents  whether they are evil like the Joker or in love as well with Rachel Dawes like Harvey Dent - simply appear to be more interesting than Bruce Wayne and even Batman himself. The screenplay isn't impeccable and generally speaking \"The Dark Knight\" definitely isn't the number one greatest movie ever made, but it's undoubtedly a marvelous film and slightly superior than the predecessor \"Batman Begins\". This first sequel is much more sinister, with a couple of shocking revelations and unexpected twists. I still miss the typically Tim Burtonesque depiction of Gotham City, but Christopher Nolan does realize more and more that Batman is a tormented figure and his story takes place in a depressing and pauperized city. The stunts and special effects are very spectacular and impressive, and particularly because the use of digital effects is kept reasonably low. Very much recommended, but of course you were already planning to watch it, anyway.",

It kept me interested throughout the film, and in fact most of the time my hands were sweaty from all the excitement and suspense.It's amazing that it does not require tight editing, excessive gore or senseless violence to make the film exciting. Christopher Nolan really knows how to tell a story and transform it into a masterpiece that is not only entertaining, but also thrilling and memorable at the same time.

But your jaw will drop and your stomach will rattle in your throat every time you see the Joker appear on screen. Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)will team up with Lieutenant Jim Gordon(Gary Olham)and the new District Attorney Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart)to battle the criminal mastermind, The Joker(Heath Ledger). The Joker's prowess all but has Gotham City on its knees. And Batman comes close to appearing as a vigilante as he tries to end the Joker's anarchy. Flawlessly clever cinematography and the special effects are rampant and high octane. The late Heath Ledger is more than brilliant as the Joker. Those psychotic and demonic mannerisms brings the character to a whole new level. The Oscar buzz grows louder and the actor's efforts are worthy. Maggie Gyllenhaal also turns in a standout performance as Rachel. Also appearing are: Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Eric Roberts, Anthony Michael Hall and Cillian Murphy.",

        "text": "Christopher Nolan steps back into the director's chair for this sequel to Batman Begins, which finds the titular superhero coming face to face with his greatest nemesis -- Joker in this movie entitled,The Dark Knight. Christian Bale returns to the role of Batman, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes, and Brokeback Mountain star Heath Ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful Joker makeup previously worn by Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero. Just as it begins to appear as if Batman, Lt. James Gordon,played by Gary Oldman, and District Attorney Harvey Dent,portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, are making headway in their tireless battle against the criminal element, a maniacal, wisecracking fiend plunges the streets of Gotham City into complete chaos.Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut in 1940, and the 1996 series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. In addition elements of Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers' Dark Detective miniseries as well as the unpublished follow-up were reportedly cannibalized along with other elements of Batman mythology for the story.In Gotham City, the Joker and accomplices rob a mob-owned bank, the Joker killing off the others and escaping alone. Batman and Lieutenant Jim Gordon decide to include the district attorney Harvey Dent in on their plan to bring down Gotham's mob, currently led by Sal Maroni. Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne meets Dent and Rachel Dawes, deciding to host a fund raiser to show his support for Dent. The Joker approaches the mob, offering them his services should they need it. Corrupt accountant Lau, working for the mob, flees to Hong Kong but is dragged back to Gotham by Batman, agreeing to testify against the mob.Maroni and the Chechen turn to the Joker who begins murdering people on a daily basis unless Batman unmasks himself. Among the casualties are Commissioner Loeb. The Joker targets Dent at the fund raiser, Bruce hiding him. The Joker tries to assassinate Mayor Garcia during Loeb's memorial service, Gordon taking the bullet and seemingly dying. Rachel is targeted, Bruce and Alfred Pennyworth looking after her. At a press conference, Dent claims he is Batman instead of Bruce who planned to confess to the public, and is escorted by police to county prison. The Joker intercepts, but is caught by Gordon, who faked his death. Gordon is promoted to Commissioner as a reward. However, Rachel and Dent both disappear, Batman confronting the Joker and learning both are in building filled with explosives. Batman and Gordon go to save them, Batman finding Dent and saving him, but Rachel is killed when the explosives detonate. Dent's face is set on fire and half of it is left severely scarred. The Joker escapes from the Gotham police department with Lau.Coleman Reese, an accountant working at Wayne Enterprises under Lucius Fox, realizes Bruce is Batman and plans to publicly expose him. The Joker, who kills Lau and the Chechen, threatens to bomb a hospital unless Reese is killed. Gordon rescues Reese, while the Joker visits the crazed Dent in hospital, convincing him to get revenge on those who \"truly\" killed Rachel. Dent kills Officer Wuertz, and spares Maroni and Officer Anna Ramirez, using his lucky coin to decide their fate. The Joker threatens to takeover the city, putting two ferries of citizens and Arkham Asylum inmates against one another, giving them to decision to blow each other up. Batman confronts the Joker, aided by Lucius using a machine able to detect phones across the city and use them as a locator. The ferry passengers refuse to kill each other, and Batman captures the Joker, but not before he learns of Dent's rampage. Dent lures Gordon to the building where Rachel died, holding his family hostage and threatens to shoot his son. Batman arrives, tackling Dent off the building to his death.Deciding to take the blame for Dent's victims, Batman forces Gordon to make him a fugitive and portray Dent as Gotham's true hero. In the closing scenes, Gordon destroys the Bat Signal, and Lucius watches the locator machine self-destruct, and Batman flees the police, Gordon considering Batman the city's real hero.Dark, complex and unforgettable, The Dark Knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.It becomes more than just a superhero film unlike the others released like Superman,Spiderman,Green Latern and many others as it was more than a comic-book adventure but a sprawling crime epic.Allusions to our current struggles with surveillance, public perception and terrorism are thrown into the mix, adding political immediacy to Nolan's psycho noir.The acting of the cast was simply superb and outstanding particularly the late Heath Ledger,whose last role the Joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time.Finally,this also proves that Christopher Nolan is much, much smarter than your average filmmaker.It was simply one of the best films ever made and the best superhero film ever made.",

        "text": "Two things interesting about this for me. (I'll let others talk about Heath.)One is how much more of a comic book it is than a film. I don't mean that it is sillier or more fantastic, but that the values seem to be based on storyboards as panels. The implications are pretty interesting. All those Marvel productions are pretty much the same: the same level of fantasy, the same vocabulary of cinematic effects. The same slant from \"graphic novel\" framing to modern film traditions  which incidentally are less designed than are the accidents of common CGI compositing tools.This on the other hand is not cinematic. It makes it boring for me visually, but there's another result: the story. The story is not your standard long form arc. Its at least four stories concatenated, as if you would read a few pages and come back at the next lunch break. It rambles, it has real comicbook soap opera. I really do think of this as a comic book that accidentally finds itself in a film. That's as opposed to \"Sin City,\" which though based on a comic, and supposedly co- directed by the comic artist, is intensely cinematic, so much so you almost drown.The other feature for me: the handling of noir.Noir is all about how the viewer manipulates the action by viewing. It has permeated nearly every corner of film and most intelligent filmmakers try to play with it. It is the primary narrative tool we have to add depth by adding layers. The Nolans are intelligent filmmakers. While the film isn't very cinematic, the script is, in this regard. The novel trick here is the joker. Sure he is played well, and Ledger was becoming one of our foremost folded actors. But the thing works because the role was written to matter, and that's because he introduces a double noir fold. The watcher is in the film, and the watcher is \"writing\" the script regardless of any action that anyone in the film can take. Its classic noir doubled. The joker's key speeches even cover all the noir highlights: you have to ruin routine; you have to profoundly affect, even kill random innocents; you have to express an amazingly complex orchestration and make it seem capricious, accidental. You have to deny intent and complexity. You have to pretend to not be amused.All these things are embodied in what Ledger was given. This is very important writing, and if you know \"Prestige\" and \"Memento,\" even \"Following,\" you would have expected something like this. Even if the film isn't good as a film, the writing is, and that allows Heath to make a film within. Its why \"Clockwork Orange\" is so important.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

Yes, Batman is as amazing as always, but he is perhaps more human, this time out. That might be because of the intelligent treatment, its director, Christopher Nolan, working with his brother, Jonathan, conceived as a clever approach to the protector of all good causes in Gotham. Not being this our favorite genre, we gave it the benefit of the doubt, and we were impressed with what we saw. Naturally, the film works because of the fantastic job of the late Heath Ledger, who runs away with the picture. Not to take from the star, Christian Bale, but the screen smolders whenever the evil joker, impersonated by Mr. Ledger, appears in front of the action. It's impossible to take ones eyes away from this actor throughout the duration of the movie.The creators have conveniently disposed of Robin, Batman's sidekick that is absent since the previous installment, thus eliminating the problem presented by was perhaps a gay duo; the new take on Batman makes him into a macho figure that talks with a husky voice, perhaps trying to prove he is not a closet case.The cast is impeccable. Christian Bale makes a great Batman. Actors of the caliber of Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, the charismatic Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and the incomparable Michael Caine, who returns as Alfred Pennyworth. What's more amazing is that Mr. Nolan and his team have meshed all the elements and have given us a film that is fun, full of action, and at the same time, it packs a lot of entertainment.Wally Pfister's cinematography plus Lee Smith editing, works wonder in the film. The musical score is by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Technically, the film makes the viewer think how did all was accomplished. It's not easy task to put all the elements together and come out with a winning film this neat.Thanks should go to Christopher Nolan for his vision and a posthumous salute to the great Heath Ledger for what he gave us.",

And everyone plays their roles with so much authority that you find yourself drawn in by the many characters on display.Along with HEATH LEDGER, there's Christian BALE, GARY OLDMAN, MICHAEL CAINE, MORGAN FREEMAN, MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL (a welcome replacement for Katie Holmes), CILLIAN MURPHY and ERIC ROBERTS (Julia's brother), and all of them are admirably cast. Special mention, too, for AARON ECKHART's role as Dist. Atty. Harvey Dent or Two-Face. He's excellent.Furthermore, the cinematography, sets, costumes and CGI are of the highest order, as is a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.If you relish this sort of entertainment, it's not to be missed. And I certainly agree that Ledger's energetic performance must have required an amazing amount of energy and skill to pull off. He's created a vivid portrait and surely deserves an Oscar nomination this year.Summing up: Definitely not for the kiddies. Too much of it is on the dark side. Stunning to watch.",

        "text": "OK--this review will be FULL OF SPOILERS so please read it at your own risk.Batman (Christian Bale) is trying to clean up Gotham City with Police Chief Gordon (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman) and crusading D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). However a psychotic madman named the Joker (Heath Ledger) wants to take over Gotham (for no discernible reason) and kill the Batman. His plans get increasingly more diabolical, many people die and Batman starts to wonder if he can stop the Joker...and if he's responsible for him.OK--I realize the Batman movies are supposed to be dark--but THIS dark??? This movie is chock full of violence--people are casually shot to death left and right(but there's no blood so I guess that makes it OK). There are some spectacular stunts here but all the violence and dark tone rob them of any of the wonder they might have had. There's next to no light moments and the movie gets increasingly depressing as it goes on. And the Joker casually hurts or kills people with no warning. There's also a thoroughly despicable scene where a little child is threatened with a gun. This deserved an R--NOT a PG-13.The needlessly convoluted story doesn't help. The movie goes on far too long (lots of people in my theatre were checking the time during the last hour) and gets confusing. Characters appear and disappear with alarming infrequency and one character (the guy who was going to reveal Batman's secret identity) disappears completely with no resolution to his story! The Joker here is rightly played as a psychotic madman but Ledger is NOT good in the role. His speeches sound stilted and he's not really acting at all. His character isn't frightening--just incredibly annoying. I found it hard to believe that all these characters were stupid enough to buy his \"explanations\". Also he plans some explosions and plots that are just impossible--even in a comic book movie.Acting does help. Bale is just excellent--he's not getting enough praise for his acting. He manages to show Batman's anger and pain even in that padded suit and mask! Eckhart is just superb as Harvey Dent--and Two-Face later on. Maggie Gyllenhaal (taking over for Katie Holmes) and Michael Caine (as Alfred) were also good. Surprisingly Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman aren't that good. They seem to be phoning in their performances. Ledger--what can I say? He's WAY over praised. He was OK but all this talk of an Academy Award is just ridiculous! He wasn't that good. His death was tragic and I can't imagine what his family is going through--but a tragic death does not automatically make you a great actor.I basically found this movie too dark, too violent and even dull! Some of the acting and fantastic special effects can only work a little. This gets a 3 from me.",

        "text": "Apart from the usual summer blockbuster expectations, this film acquired an instant mythical aura all its own following Heath Ledger's untimely demise (which inevitably borders on overhype). As long-rumored, Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is electrifying and leaves one in no doubt of the late actor's talent and versatility; still, though undeniably creepy – especially given his penchant for macabre TV appearances – he lacks the flamboyance (even if he does get to appear in drag!) and sense of fun that The Joker of Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson and even the animated series possessed! Besides, I don't understand why he's seen constantly recruiting henchmen from the other Gotham gangs when the film-makers chose to depict him as such a manic, trigger-happy thug that he does practically all of the shooting himself – with his anonymous lackeys being there merely to get treacherously shot in the back or hand him weapons! And what's up with leaving him dangling from a stairwell? It's not like he's coming back in the inevitable third entry, no? Incidentally, I feel that all the ongoing talk of posthumously awarding Ledger an Oscar in tribute is premature. By the way, the fact that the film is currently topping the all-time 250 list on IMDb – not that I ever cared for that particular list myself, mind you – is, quite frankly, ridiculous! While I can't really complain of it ever being slow, the film's 152-minute running-time is definitely excessive and could easily have been thinned down by as much as 45 minutes if some of the less interesting vignettes were dropped altogether: among the many needlessly intricate subplots, the chief offenders were the whole Asian financier segment, the dead-end assault on the Japanese skyscraper full of hostages and the climactic 'confrontation' between the two respective shiploads of evacuated citizens and jailbirds. Personally, I don't understand why the film-makers chose to divide the time between the Scarecrow (albeit a mere cameo from Cillian Murphy but welcome nonetheless), the mobsters, The Joker and Two-Face rather than devote a leaner (if consequently less ambitious) narrative to the most famous of Batman's opponents – as indeed Tim Burton's 1989 revival of the caped crusader had itself done. At the very end, I also didn't get why tolerated vigilante Batman must suddenly become a hunted fugitive from the law for the good of Gotham – what for and on whose authority? Gary Oldman's final monologue was supposed to shed some light on this, I guess, but I didn't catch some of it because of the music drowning out the dialogue! The returning actors from the first film of this new franchise (Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman) have all grown nicely into their roles – especially Caine and Oldman (so much so that I was disappointed to see him get 'bumped off' half-way through); that said, Batman himself seemed to be merely engaged in action sequences or else make split-second appearances to make his latest report to Gordon; by the way, I too found his scowling demeanor irritating – which his raspy voice sometimes rendered inaudible! On the other hand, the new additions to the fold – Aaron Eckhart (as unlucky D.A. Harvey 'Two-Face' Dent) and his gushing secretary Maggie Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes) – were less impressive (and their relationship equally dreary and time-consuming), which is just as well since both their characters lose their lives by the end of it (or so we are led to believe); Two-Face was supposed to be another criminal mastermind but, here, all he seems to care about is avenge his lover's death! Incidentally, I never thought I'd say this, but I enjoyed seeing Eric Roberts playing the meaty supporting role of one of Gotham's leading mobsters.Where special effects are concerned, the spectacular capsizing of the trailer was the film's most breath-taking moment and Two-Face's CGI-animated facial decomposition was not too distracting under the circumstances (reminding one of Griffin Dunne from AN American WEREWOLF IN London [1981]). Those of you who've read thus far may be questioning my eventual *** rating but, seriously, I did enjoy the film and there were certainly several good sequences and performances in it but, overall, in the words of George Harrison, \"it's all too much\"",

        "text": "\"Batman Begins\" writer & director Christopher Nolan's new Caped Crusader saga \"The Dark Knight\" qualifies as too much of a good thing. In other words, the movie boasts greater ambitions than its lengthy 152 minutes can accommodate. Mind you, \"The Dark Knight\" is every bit as good as \"Batman Begins.\" The chief difference is that this Batman sequel flaunts bigger and better production values as well as loftier aims.Not only does \"The Dark Knight\" align our hero with Bob Kane's original vigilante creation, but it also reinvents the Batman's nefarious nemesis, the Harlequin of Hatethe Joker. The Joker drives Batman over the edge! He ranks as an unforgettable villain. While Nolan and his brother Jonathan remain faithful to the spirit of Kane's Batman, this sequel indulges in derring-do more outlandish and audacious than its predecessor and depicts the showdown between Batman and the Joke as a duel of titans.During its initial two hours, this white-knuckled, larger-than-life, adventure epic keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, it sacrifices that momentum in the last 30 minutes with a convoluted subplot that turns into a predictable and pretentious mediation on good citizenship. Although Batman has been around since 1939, the Nolan brothers deserve kudos for taking this unique American crime fighter to the next level. Furthermore, amid all the adrenaline-laced activities and high octane explosions, the Nolans have concocted a crackerjack near-classic with more on its mind that hair-raising heroics.\"The Dark Knight\" opens with an imaginative bank robbery. Gun-toting, clown-faced robbers kill each other as each completes their phase of the crime. The hold-up and the getaway are nimbly staged, except there's an inherent flaw. If you think about it, how can the Joker recruit high-class henchmen if he has them knock each other off? Nevertheless, we learn quickly that the Joker is the ultimate anarchist. He refuses to play by the rules, and the Nolans generate a lot of melodrama about Batman's vigilante efforts to apprehend him. \"Hancock\" beat \"The Dark Knight\" to the punch about the price of vigilantism. Not only do the authorities want to catch the Joker, but they also wouldn't mind nabbing the Batman.Incorruptible Lieutenant Jim Gordon (a mustached and bespectacled Gary Oldman of \"True Romance\") is the only cop that Batman trusts. Naturally, Gordon is reluctant to let crusading Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart of \"No Reservations\") into the loop. Although the mobsters have been piling up loot, laundering it, and then hiding it in Gotham's banks with a Chinese gangster Lau (Chin Han of \"3 Needles\") protecting their earnings, Batman and Lt. Gordon devise a clever way to identify mob money. Inevitably, the Asian mastermind skips Gotham for the sanctuary of China where he expects to escape extradition. Batman shocks Lau with a surprise visit. The Caped Crusader's excursion beyond Gotham City constitutes a first for the film franchise. Batman's abduction of the Asian crime lord resembles similar abductions from the John Wayne Vietnam war movie \"The Green Beret\" and the Timothy Dalton 007 caper \"License to Kill.\" No sooner have the authorities jailed Lau than the Joker approaches Gotham City's criminal cartel with a new plan. The Joker's first scene where he makes a pencil disappear is hilarious. Meanwhile, since Wayne Manor melted down in \"Batman Begins,\" our hero has had to relocate to make-shift quarters. Bruce Wayne realizes that Batman is something bigger than he had imagined, including the copycat Batmen prowling the city. Being the Batman, as \"The Dark Knight\" shows, is no picnic. Our hero has acquired his share of bruises, wounds, and dog bites, and he has his top man at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman of \"Unforgiven\"), developing a dog-proof Bat suit. Despite his crime busting exploits, Bruce yearns for the day that he can drop the masquerade and wed childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes. The nihilistic Joker doesn't give him much breathing room in this installment.Warner Brothers, DC Comics and the Nolan brothers will have to manufacture a miracle to top this slam-bang, gravity-defying actioneer. Christian Bale surpasses Michael Keaton, George Clooney, and Val Kilmer as Batman. Bale's Batman is more realistic, more sympathetic, and the Welsh star's lean wolfish looks make him look treacherous. In short, Bale is the best Batman since Adam West! The late Heath Ledger really gets under the clown make-up as the Joker. Aaron Eckhart's vigorous performance as Harvey Dent is no less sterling. Alas, the Nolans give Dent the short shrift when they shoehorn his dramatic makeover carelessly in the final half-hour. Leggy Maggie Gyllenhaal isn't much of an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Composers Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard provide a powerful, atmospheric orchestral score that sets the mood and accentuates the cliffhanger heroics. At the same time, Christopher Nolan wastes no time getting the action in gear. Nolan maintains momentum and suspense while scattering surprises throughout the mayhem. Only during the last 30 minutes does the story begin to unravel. No, \"The Dark Knight\" isn't the masterpiece that \"Iron Man\" was, but this latest entry in the Batman franchise proves you can have your Cape and eat it, too!",

        "text": "I have always contended and will continue to trumpet that the villain makes the movie as much as the hero. As much as one may love Batman, if Batman has to conquer his fear of peanut butter, no one would watch. Even if Batman had his hands full with your everyday street punk, still it would not be a good movie. But alas, Batman was opposed by the criminally insane Joker who has propelled to the top of the villain chart.The Joker has now etched his name alongside the likes of Darth Vader, whom we revered because of his power, his resolve and his ruthlessness. The Joker has also etched his name alongside the likes of Hannibal Lechter who defined mad genius. The Joker is the new mad genius. And as much credit as Heath Ledger deserves for doing a great job, the writers deserve equal if not more credit for the phenomenal story.Sure, Heath Ledger brought the Joker character to life, but only the writer(s) could give the Joker the maniacal brilliance that he had. Each demented plan was insanely brilliant. And what set the Joker apart the most was his drive and his motive. He was not the villain seeking untold riches with every plan leading to it. He was not the villain seeking ultimate power or immortality with every plan leading to it. Nor was he the villain seeking to rule the universe with every plan leading to it. He was seeking chaos, which did not allow for the hero to hold a bargaining chip and it did not allow the hero to exploit a known weakness. He wanted chaos and he achieved chaos by playing on peoples greed, fear, anger and desperation. The only way that the Joker could be undone was by the people themselves.This movie was superb. It was masterfully written and executed. I dare not request an encore because I can't imagine them topping this.",

        "text": "In all fairness, I wasn't jumping and screaming when \"Batman Begins\" got released. Although it was a good movie, it just wasn't without its flaws. I even must admit I preferred Tim Burton's \"Batman\" over it. It's great to see that almost all of its flaws and other inconsistencies are fixed for this sequel to Christopher Nolan's \"Batman Begins\".Still it looks at first in the movie its first halve that the movie starts to make the same mistakes all over again. The movie doesn't have a clear main plot-line in terms of knowing which directing the movie is going to head towards and there are many (new) characters again who also all are getting introduced all over again. The movie takes its time to tell what happened to all of the characters in between \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight\" and it shows who are going to be the new characters in this one. Luckily when the movie reaches its halve way point this all changes and the movie basically becomes a great thrilling and spectacular movie to watch. Its story starts to make some great turns and even presents some unexpected welcome twists in it. Without spoiling too much, some people are dying in this movie but perhaps not the people or person you would expect to. Also Harvey Dent/Two-Face plays a much bigger and more important role in the movie than anticipated. I expected his character to be developed and first set up in this movie and that he would later continue on playing the main villain in the third new Batman movie but he's already an established and important character in this movie and it also definitely features more of Two-Face than I anticipated in advance.It's a true superior movie that gets uplifted by its exciting plot and sequences. it's still obvious that Nolan just ain't no action director but he certainly did a much better job with it in this movie. It's a fast going movie, that features quite an amount of action but with never forgetting or loosing its main focus on the more realistic and humane aspects of the movie and Batman character. It's not as 'poetic' as \"Batman Begins\" but still it continues on the same trend with its approach of story and characters.Luckily this movie has one clear main big villain this time, something \"Batman Begins\" was really lacking, with its many- and very different villains. There is no doubt that the biggest and craziest crook of this movie is the Joker. More or less the Joker really makes the movie, which not in the least is of course thanks to the way he gets very memorably portrayed by Heath Ledger, in one of his final film roles before his unfortunate early death before the movie its release. You can perhaps even say that it was the Joker that killed Heath Ledger. He was suffering heavily from sleeping problems, right before, during and after wrapping up his Joker role, which resulted in his accidental overdose of prescription drugs. The character also must have really been an absorbing one, since he obviously gets sucked right into his role. He just is the Joker in this movie and there is no holding him back.But is it just me or are with all this talk about Heath Ledger people are forgetting or simply not seeing that the biggest and most important role of this movie is not being played by Christian Bale or Heath Ledger but by Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. From both the good guys and the bad guys perspective he is the most important and influential character of the entire movie.And in all fairness and objectivity, since all this talk is going on, I don't think Ledger will get an Oscar for his role in this movie. it just isn't the type of role and movie for ANY actor to ever win an Oscar, though he most likely will still (deservingly so) receive an Oscar-nod. But most important and sad thing- Oscar win or no Oscar win, is that Heath Ledger is no more. One of the most talented new young actors in the business, with the potential of becoming one of the best and respected actors in the business, who would had continued to play more memorable roles, like he did in this movie, as well as in some of his previous ones. It wasn't his last movie role though and he can still be seen next year in Terry Gilliam's \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\", which release date got pushed back due to Ledger's death since he died during the filming of that movie.But back to \"The Dark Knight\", it's true that Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne are being pushed somewhat to the background in this movie, with the presence of the Joker and Harvey Dent/Two-Face. But somehow I have the feeling this was intentional from Nolan, who obviously constantly doesn't want to portray Batman as a superhero and he allows more the other characters around him to play the true heroic parts of the movie, also in order to let the Batman character himself seem more humane and realistic.Realism is obviously an approach picked by Nolan for his Batman movies. Still the movie features some over-the-top action, which is welcome though, since it makes the movie a greatly exciting as well as spectacular one. The storytelling, character handling as well as the overall look of the movie are being kept as realistic as possible, which make this movie, as well as the entire Nolan Batman franchise (no doubt he will direct more Batman movies) different from the usual superhero movie franchise. \"The Dark Knight\" is more clever, more subtle, which makes it also more original but it luckily doesn't go at the expense of the movie its entertainment.Already one of the best, most exciting and spectacular movies of 2008.9/10",

I have no problem with these people, and I won't claim that this is all the way perfect - one can wonder if any film could truly be - but this does have undeniably impressive aspects. This is an excellent movie, and not only for being based on graphic novels. The psychology is magnificent, and goes far beyond the one-note \"fear\" approach of the first. It can be argued how close it all is to the comics, however, a lot of the tone and concept comes through, and will be accessible to the majority of viewers. Is this not the most intimidating and strongest portrayal of The Joker on the big screen(and the idea behind him is interesting)? Ledger(R.I.P.) disappeared into the performance, and one can understand why it might have affected him personally. The acting, in general, is impeccable. Bale(in spite of having utterly and completely forgotten how to do the voice of the black-clad vigilante...?), Caine, Freeman, Oldman all do great, again. Gyllenhaal was a good replacement for Holmes. Eckhart is spot-on. The complexity of this is admirable. The amount of plot, that one can actually still follow it all, and that it all comes together with nothing going underdeveloped or unused is astounding. The surprises work enormously well. Granted, not everything remains entirely credible. The effects are marvelous. The comedy works well, few jokes fall flat. The dialog is well-written and delivered equally well. The action is awesome, and it does not take over, the focus is still on the material and what is explored, not what gets blown up or who has a fight scene. Might I add, Nolan got better at shooting it, it never looks bad in this, and tends to be exciting and engaging. The music is well-composed, and it stays enough in the background as to not detract from the whole. There is a little moderate language, no sexuality, and quite a few disturbing sights, sounds and thoughts. The DVD has extras, including featurettes(oddly devoid of talking heads, done more with still shots with the crew and/or Christopher talking over them) dealing with the IMAX cameras, the score and others, photo galleries, trailers and TV-spots. I recommend this very warmly to any fan of Batman, the director and/or anyone else involved in making this. 10/10",

Batman is a mere mortal with lots of time to train himself physically and money to design the nifty gadgets he uses.Everybody on earth has seen this film, so no use regurgitating the plot. I think Heath Ledger's rendition of The Joker is a masterpiece. Every time he leaves the screen I keep waiting for him to come back. Ledger should have won the best actor Oscar rather than supporting actor, because this is really a two leading man film - Bale as Batman and Ledger as The Joker. I always liked Jack Nicholson's rendition of the Joker in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton, but Ledger just blows Nicholson's performance away. Maybe it is because Nicholson's Joker had a past and an explanation for his behavior, maybe it is because, after all, Nicholson's Joker just seems to be the wild side of the real Jack Nicholson where Heath Ledger never steps out of character for the entire film. Ledger's Joker is like the devil decides to become incarnate, but unlike Ray Milland's devil in \"Alias Nick Beal\" shows his true self - somebody who wants to break the spirits of people, to turn them on one another, to wantonly destroy property, people, whatever. That's reinforced when the police can find no name, no past, no prints, no DNA, not even a label in his clothes when they arrest him. His past is a great big question mark. I like Michael Caine's Alfred - it's good to have someone with relevant past combat and guerrilla experience be a wise father figure to Wayne in this role rather than just a kindly museum piece. Likewise, Morgan Freeman is pitch perfect as Lucius and Wayne's version of Q - somebody who invents his gadgets and runs his business since this really is not where Wayne's mind is, Freeman gives the performance the perfect balance of humor, business acumen, and conscience. And finally I like the fact that Rachel, Bruce Wayne's love interest, is not played by someone who is some unrealistic 10.5/10. She's a cute girl, but her attributes lie in her mind and her heart as well.The negatives - I think Harvey's transformation into Two Face is a little too pat. I don't know why Batman has a totally different voice from Bruce Wayne. Is he doing that on purpose? And I think I found one editing error. Gordon in the end talks about how hard it will be to cover up Harvey/ Two Face's murders including \"two cops\". Harvey let crooked cop Ramirez live and just knocked her out. But if she had lived then Gordon and Batman's plan to cover up Harvey's crimes would never have worked because she would have known what happened. So which scene was wrongly included/scripted? I'd recommend it as one of the better films made since the turn of the century that was also a blockbuster.",

        "text": "Whatever else it may be, \"The Dark Knight,\" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his \"Batman Begins,\" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since \"Citizen Kane.\" Grade: A",

Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's fantastic interpretation/adaptation of Bob Kane's seminal comic book hero continues its flights of fancy in this amazingly realized sequel incorporating the very dark, dank images of Frank Miller's 1986 take on the eponymous avenger with a tormented Bruce Wayne/Batman (brooding, intensely conflicted Bale continuing to deliver the goods mixing courage and vulnerability and an Eastwoodian rasp as The Caped Crusader) facing many obstacles, namely his boyhood crush/best friend ADA Rachel Dawes (loosey-goosey, unconventional beauty Gyllenhaal, replacing the lush Katie Holmes, and adding some brainy feist) is now hooking up with Gotham's golden boy \"white knight\" politico/DA Harvey Dent (Eckhart exuding Kennedy charisma to boot) making waves by gunning after a new threat to the fair city: The Joker (the late, stunningly great Ledger in sadly his last completed starring role; a towering, staggering achievement here rivaling Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal \"the Cannibal\" Lecter in a truly unnerving, creepy villainous turn to last for the ages), a homicidal harlequin, whose terror-inducing anarchy sets the stage for apocalyptic mayhem. Nolan  who co-wrote with his brother Jonathan and David S. Goyer- hatches a decent plot line paralleling the dual dichotomies of his hero and villain both 'freaks' whose psyches are severely hot-wired and ready for action. Ably supported by most of the returning cast from \"BATMAN BEGINS\" : Caine as manservant/nurse-maid Alfred the Butler continues to be the storyline's underscored conscience; Oldman as Lt. James Gordon the only honest man left in a corrupt city; Foreman as the \"Q\" to Wayne's Bond has a foxy-loxy air about him; and Roberts handles oily menace as a tough gangster getting in everyone's way. Kudos to the spectacular lensing by Nolan's frequent collaborator the unheralded Wally Pfister; Nathan Crowley's splendid transformation of Chicago into Gotham City and overall production design; John Caglione's amazing make-up inspirations  particularly Dent's tragic \"Two-Face\" concoction; and the pulsing, throbbing, murkily propulsive score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.But the true price of admission is Ledger's feckless, gleefully anarchic virtuoso turn as The Joker, with his sloppily slathered on greasepaint and odd Chicagoan accent (it sounds eerily like Dan Aykroyd in \"DR. DETROIT\"!), herky-jerky movements, slippery tongue flicking like a louche lizard and a cross between a possessed ventriloquist puppet and Jim Morrison  a resuscitated corpse come to life  is the legendary stuff made especially for cinematic time capsules and a much deserved (posthumously so) Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger nails it perfectly so; a thing of rapacious beauty with dank élan. The film itself deserves many Academy notices including Picture, Director, Make-up and Screenplay to name several; it'd be foolish if it weren't. One of the year's very best films and perhaps one of the best sequels to a franchise.",

There have been other movies in the genre which have grabbed me more on first viewing, but I'll have to do a bit of thinking before I can nail that thought down with precision.The thing it does do, to an extent which I didn't think would be possible, is to take the idea of a fully established Batman (as opposed to the creation/origin Batman in Begins) as well as Joker and Two-Face, put them into a world which is recognisably the real world (as opposed to the stylised Gotham of the Burton movies), and have them all be credible characters. I except here only the Two-Face makeup - I thought it was great, but I worried about the absence of tear ducts.The film is long, but there is a lot of plot going on. Attention needs to be paid - there are lots of details, and they can escape easily.The main players reprise their roles from last time, and it's good to see Gary Oldman's James Gordon having a much bigger slice of the pie this time. Together with Caine's Alfred and Freeman's Lucius Fox they create a solid foundation of decency for Bale's Batman to operate against.Credit to both Heath Ledger for a genuinely scary Joker, and also to Aaron Eckhart for a performance which makes Harvey Dent's tragedy very clear (and, perhaps, turns it into the heart of this movie). Is Ledger's performance worthy of an Oscar nomination? Well, the Academy likes showy, gimmicky characters, and Ledger's untimely death will undoubtedly have increased the chances even more, so I wouldn't bet against it.The stunts are fine and the effects are fine - nothing so outrageous that disbelief can't remain suspended. The script is good, and some of the music cues are remarkable. However, there were places where I felt that the sound balance favoured music and effects over dialogue - Gordon's words at the very end, for instance.This has been a very good year for films in this genre, and this film is one of the best in this (or any other) year.",

It's at this time that one particular masked gunman kills his accomplices one by one and subsequently escapes with all of the loot. As it turns out the last surviving robber is a criminal mastermind known as \"the Joker\" (Heath Ledger) and he is as psychotic as they come. The scene then shifts to a parking garage where two criminal gangs are having a meeting when suddenly two people dressed as Batman arrive and a shootout ensues. Suddenly the real \"Batman\" (Christian Bale) enters the picture and not only subdues the criminals but also the Batman impersonators as well. Needless to say, it's only a matter of time before the Joker and Batman collide head on-and there will be a lot of chaos and mayhem along the way. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I honestly didn't think anybody could top the performance of Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the \"Batman\" movie of 1989. But I am here to say that Heath Ledger totally dominated the Joker persona like nobody else has ever done. He was truly excellent. Likewise, Christian Bale also performed quite well as Batman. Along with that, the movie itself was one of the better \"Batman\" films ever produced as well. That being said, I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

Much of this can be attributed to the exceptional writing and much of this can be attributed to the amazing performances in one of the best ensemble casts in film history. In fact, anyone who considers themselves a film buff or a serious student of film cannot say so unless they have seen this film. I also wish all young directors and writers were forced to watch the film as it demonstrates the power of excellent writing and acting. Imagine...a film that is great that does NOT have special effects, was filmed in black and white, and 99% of which takes place in one small room.Aside from Henry Fonda, all the other actors are a virtual \"who's who\" of supporting character actors from the 1950s--and all were at the top of their game in this film. Unfortunately, the film has been parodied and copied so many times that the film's originality has been blunted. Oddly, one of the parodies of this plot came from the TV show \"The Odd Couple\"--which starred Jack Klugman who was ALSO in 12 ANGRY MEN! See this film. And, if it turns out you don't like it, then I suggest you see a psychiatrist!!!",

The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda.

At that time in those sexist fifties women had an automatic out from jury duty. It was not unusual to have all male juries as we have here.Then I served on a few juries and my concepts changed. One of the key scenes of the film is when Henry Fonda produces a switchblade knife exactly like the weapon the young perpetrator allegedly used in the stabbing death of his father. The second that Fonda produced that knife, someone should have yelled for a mistrial.In all 50 states of the United States of America, a standard jury instruction is that the jury is to decide the guilt or innocence of a defendent on the evidence presented at trial. Jurors are free to come and go until they are sequestered for the verdict. But they are instructed not to go near the crime scene or gather ANY independent evidence. I remember being on jury duty and assigned on a case where the crime took place in an apartment that was one block away from one of two routes to a BMT subway stop that took me to work. And those same subways also took me to downtown Brooklyn and the court house. I made it a point to take the IRT to court for the next two weeks while the trial went on to avoid the temptation of going over to the crime scene.It was a great dramatic effect, but totally at odds with our legal system. I can't believe that something that elementary was left in a film that was purported to be a realistic look at jury deliberations.The juries I was on did debate and in some cases quibble over all the points of the trial. They were a good cross section of the breed Brooklynus Americanus just as in 12 Angry Men. If you watch Law and Order you know how hard the prosecutors job is to get 12 people to convict.Still it's a wonderful group of players that participated here. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are the biggest names in the cast. But others like Robert Webber, John Fiedler, Martin Balsam, and Jack Klugman got their first real notice in this film.Jack Klugman's portrayal was a particular favorite of mine among the group. He's from the same slum background as the defendent and some of the knowledge he has from that environment makes for the most compelling argument for the defendent's innocence. We should be thankful that Sidney Lumet assembled and directed the find cast he did.",

Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Bins, Jack Warden, Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber are the twelve jurors and it's going to be hard trying to find a film with as much great acting as what we see here. I really think this is one of the greatest screenplays to be written for any movie since the movie only runs 96-minutes and we've got all the evidence to listen to and watch them discuss it but we also get to know each one of them personally with just a few remarks, which tells us everything about them. Another important aspect is the direction by Lumet, which might be the best of his career, which is certainly saying a lot considering how many great films he has made over the years. There's nothing getting blown up here and there are no gunshots but this film, in terms of drama and suspense, can rival any action movie ever made for those edge of your seat thrills. The cinematography is also top-notch as the camera just floats around the juror's room picking up pieces of the action. What I love most about movies is when you get great actors going at each other in a great screenplay and I can't think of a movie that does this better than this one right here. There is so much excitement as the men, who all believe they are right, slowly fight and tear away at one another until the thrilling end. All of the performances are wonderful and what better than having a mild Fonda going up against the anger of Cobb. The final sequence is brilliantly handled and doesn't come off as forced or silly. On the top this is certainly a courtroom drama but underneath the film plays more like a lesson of this countries legal Constitution and why it is so great.",

Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied.

        "text": "Theater at its best is practically impossible to get down on film correctly. When Hollywood gets it right, they create a work of art. In this case, they did it simply, without frills, casting actors who looked real and fell into their individual parts like kids into a swimming pool on a hot summers day. It's the hottest day of the year, and these twelve men must decide the fate of an accused killer. But twelve men means twelve personalities, twelve temperaments, twelve political views, twelve religious opinions and twelve preconceived notions. As the temperature swells, so does the temperament. Having been a very reluctant jury foreman, I find myself seeing eye to eye with the shyness of the man forced to lead the proceedings. Everybody looks at you to get the ball rolling and hopefully get out of there as quickly as possible. Martin Balsam, as the foreman, tries to remain dignified and not be overly in control, losing that to one of the jurors who looks at the case in a completely different way than the others. Twelve personalities means plenty of neuroses, and in a very short time, seeing what's really going on in the minds of strangers whom you'll never see again.This trial involves young John Sacova, accused of killing his own father, and the twelve men must decide whether he gets the chair or not. These men, only identified through their juror number, are completely different, and it's obvious from the start that some of them (John Fiedler in particular) vote guilty because they think they have to. Only one (Henry Fonda) votes not guilty, and of course, one of them says, \"There's always one.\" There are the aggressive ones certain of guilt, empathetic ones who would like to see the charges reduced, and those who view all young people from certain areas as scum regardless of their situation. At 60 years old, this film shows the same prejudices we face today, yet shows that there is always someone not about to follow the crowd simply because something strikes them as off. It is Fonda who will pretty much control the room, although he does it in a subtle way where nobody realizes that he's pretty much taken over.While jury's have changed in 60 years (allowing women to serve being the most obvious change), what hasn't changed in the conflict of trying to understand the truth and to agree with 11 other people about it. Fonda goes against what would be allowed today by acting on his own and visiting the neighborhood of the crime, but his passion in figuring out the truth is very admirable. He is quiet in his determination, making this typical Fonda but one that fills his soul with humility and integrity.Under the direction of novice Sidney Lumet, the entire cast is outstanding. Familiar faces from all walks of show business each get their chance to shine. Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, to name a few. I could easily write something about each of them, but it's worth checking them all out yourself. The one juror who really makes an impression in creating his character is Lee J. Cobb as the very aggressive juror who is hiding behind similarities to the case, having had a contentious relationship with his son that sparks his instant sense that the defendant is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. He was deservedly nominated for a Golden Globe (as was Fonda), but the Oscars only acknowledged the film, director and script for nominations. Each jury is its own story, and from city to city, nothing changes but the type of case and the date.",

        "text": "A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one \"not guilty\" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.I'm not a massive fan of the \"Movie You Must See\" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this \"mates in a pub\" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out \"films you should see\" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a \"classic\" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled \"racist\", \"old\", \"naïve\", \"angry\" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has \"top-billing\" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the \"MYMS\" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.",

Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so.

Breaking into work groups, our task was to watch the film, and at strategically paused moments, predict which of the jurors would be the next to change their verdict from guilty to not guilty. It was an exercise in analytical thinking and observation of human behavior, characteristics that a good manager needs in order to develop a work force toward a common goal. There was actually a group that got all the positions right from one through twelve, which astounded me. Watching today, I got stuck again right at the outset, figuring Jack Klugman's Juror #5 would be the first to be influenced by Henry Fonda's argument.The film is an extraordinary piece of ensemble acting, and if the players weren't that well known back in the day, they have certainly made themselves a name since. Almost all have passed on, but to see actors like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, Ed Begley and Klugman all in one film is a veritable treat, even apart from the story. But it's the story itself that rivets one's attention to the screen, and the slow, methodical plodding Fonda brings to the table with convincing arguments even in the face of his own uncertainty about the case. With a surety that \"The facts are supposed to determine the case\", Fonda's character struggles to assure his fellow jurors that the life of an accused killer is worth the effort to consider reasonable doubt.Aside from Fonda, the two most galvanizing characters are portrayed by Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley. Begley, Juror #10, who exhibits the most extreme traits of racism and bigotry, forces each of the jurors to confront their own prejudices in an uncomfortable scene where almost every other juror stands up and turns their back on him. Cobb, Juror #3, has a much more personal investment in the trial, harboring a failed relationship with his own son that colors his view of the world. The really interesting point regarding Fonda's character is that he accomplished his mission without ever raising his voice. I don't think I could have done that considering the stakes involved.It's a rare film that can anchor the viewer in one spot for an hour and a half and make time fly by with an intriguing story and realistic dialog. Rarer still is the ability to poke a finger at one's own pre-conceived notions of guilt or innocence, forcing the serious viewer to take a seat at the jury table and examine the facts from all sides before voting guilty or not guilty.",

Eleven of the twelve jurors are certain that he's guilty, but one token odd man out dissenting juror (beautifully played with subtle understatement by Henry Fonda) has his doubts. The juror gets everyone else to question their motives and more heavily scrutinize every last minute detail of the seemingly cut and dried case.Director Sidney Lumet, working from Reginald Rose's smart, literate and incisive script, further aided by Boris Kaufman's sharp black and white cinematography and Kenyon Hopkins' spare, unobtrusive score, works wonders with the simple premise, placing a keen and intimate emphasis on the exceptionally colorful and distinctive dozen characters. The uniformly marvelous acting from a bang-up ensemble cast qualifies as a substantial sterling asset: Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are both terrific as radically opposing guys who are at continual loggerheads with each other while Ed Begley (incredibly fearless as a despicable racist jerk), Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney (simply lovely as the old man), George Voskovec, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, John Fiedler, Robert Webber, E.G. Marshall and the criminally underrated Edward Binns all lend top-drawer support in equally meaty roles. The twelve individual jurors serve as a very revealing and insightful microcosm of our justice system in particular and our society in general, representing all the various flaws, strengths and quirks of our culture which range from blithe indifference (Warden's boorish baseball fan, Webber's slick advertising executive) to cold pragmatism (Marshall's prissy intellectual) to meek passivity (Fiedler's soft-spoken wimp) to foul prejudice (Begley's unforgettably odious hatemonger, Cobb's seething ball of roaring rage and resentment) to true blue responsible patriotism (Fonda's calm voice of liberal reason, Sweeney's supportive old man, Voskovec's proud adopted American immigrant). Kaufman's gorgeously crisp photography tremendously heightens the considerable tension, palpably evoking a sweaty, uncomfortable and claustrophobic sweltering hot atmosphere that's as gripping as it is convincing. In the hands of a lesser cast and director the story could have been flat and stagy. But Lumet's tight direction and the seamless ensemble acting from an amazing cast effortlessly blend together to create a crackling sense of absorbing drama and rip-snorting energy that's constantly engrossing and exciting throughout.

Basically the jury of twelve men (a jury is always twelve people) has just come from the courtroom after hearing the defence and prosecution rest their cases, and they are now the people who must decide the verdict for the case. They must determine if a young Spanish-American is guilty or not guilty of the first degree murder by stabbing of his father, and if they all unanimously agree to find him guilty he instantly gets sentenced to death. With a weak alibi of going out to the movies and not remembering what he saw, a knife he supposedly bought and lost, and a number of witnessed hearing screams, someone shouting the words \"I'm going to kill you\" and possible seeing it happen, it seems open and shut. All Jurors have immediately decided to vote guilty, one Juror however is voting not guilty until he clears up the facts, this is Mr. Davis, aka Juror #8 (BAFTA winning Henry Fonda, also producing). At first he is voting opposite to everyone else for the sake of conversation and discussion, deliberations however crop up and he slowly straightens things out and brings forward things that the defence, prosecution and ultimately witnesses may have missed. These include Juror #8 having the same knife as the boy and pondering the stabbing, the noises going on when the murder happened, the reason for the shouted words, the timing of the old man heading to answer the door, and most importantly, a key witness who chose not to wear glasses but marks on her nose prove she does. Slowly the Jurors, some wise, bright and empathetic, one or two arrogant, prejudiced and merciless, may be seeing that this lone Juror has some good points and brings forward some good ideas as to what may have happened. Juror #3 (The Exorcist's Golden Globe nominated Lee J. Cobb) and Juror #10 (Ed Begley) for a long while seem adamant to stick to their verdicts of guilty, but slowly the others: Juror #1 (Psycho's Martin Balsam), Juror #2 (John Fiedler), Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall), Juror #5 (Jack Klugman), Juror #6 (Edward Binns), Juror #7 (Being There's Jack Warden), Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), Juror #11 (George Voskovec) and Juror #12 (Robert Webber), do start to doubt their decision is right. Being swayed by the very convincing predictions of the murder events, one by one the Jurors change their verdict to not guilty, until the final one sobbingly gives in, and in the end they all agree the boy should go free. Fonda gives a magnificent performance as the calm, collective and convincing lone voting Juror to turn the others decision, Cobb is equally fantastic as the one who takes ages to change the mind of, and the other actors all get their moments on screen as well. The one location film based on a play could have been a little dull, but director Lumet keeps you gripped with a marvellously worded script played out to perfection by the actors, with the addition of great camera work and set pieces as well, it is a brilliant classic courtroom drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Henry Fonda was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Juror #8 was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 88 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 87 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies, and it was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

        "text": "First of all, what a cast! Fonda doesn't seem like much of a New Yorker, but the rest of the cast reads like a Who's Who in New York movies. All of them except Sweeney and Voscovek went on to lengthy careers in character and support roles.The plot comes from a TV show and is very tightly written. There's hardly a wasted word or an unnecessary gesture. This has its drawbacks because it imposes a dramatic frame on the characters and the development. There's not much sense of \"real life\" here. Everything fits together too neatly for that. But if events follow earlier events with a logic that is a bit obvious, it's forgivable because the screenplay is done so well. Like \"Stagecoach,\" it may be mechanical but it's as finely tuned as a good wristwatch.Also more or less unavoidable in a short movie dealing with a dozen often conflicting characters is the reduction in their complexity. Each is a stereotype. They practically wear sweatshirts with logos on them. \"I AM A SHALLOW AD MAN.\" \"BORED MARMALADE SALESMAN HERE.\" \"KICK ME, I AM AN IGNORANT RACIST.\" They are capable of changing their opinions but they show only one side of their characters.A third unfortunate quality in the script is that it is imbued with what Tom Wolfe referred to as \"nostalgie de la bou\" -- a kind of admiration for the lowbrow. Pauline Kael made the same observation back in the early 60s in an essay called \"Fantasies of the Art House Audience.\" What it boils down to is a dislike of the middle-class. Fonda is an architect, a professional. The other good guys in the movie are members of minority groups or ordinary working stiffs with slum backgrounds. The two most repulsive villains (Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb) are self-made men who run their own successful businesses. The rufescent Begley has a line, something like, \"I got ten factories going to pot while we're talking' here.\" Cobb brags about how he built up his delivery business starting out with nothing. A third dummy is a SALESMAN -- of marmalade! (Yukk.)Okay. That gets pretty much all of the weaknesses out of the way. The pluses outweigh the minuses by exactly two short tons. The acting is almost impossible to improve upon, not surprisingly. It's unfair to single out Jack Warden and Martin Balsam for their performances but I'll do it anyway.The photography, by Boris Kaufman, is perceptive and adds to the tension, the feeling of claustrophobia. Especially memorable is the scene in which most of the jurors are standing together, there is a rumble of thunder, and a shadow falls gloomily over the group. It's a small touch but palpable.Lumet manages to suggest New York City effectively in this crowded room, practically the only set. (There is a shot at the end that is done on the steps of the real Courthouse.) Lumet's direction makes the most of his actors' talents. The pauses in their arguments last just long enough for us to take a few breaths.Rose's script avoids an easy ending. Yes, there is reasonable doubt enough for the verdict to turn out as it does, but there is no dramatic introduction of crucial evidence to demonstrate that the defendant is innocent. Did he do it? We don't know. Suppose the kid actually did it and gets away with it? Fonda is twice challenged on that point -- once at the table and once in the men's room -- and in neither instance does he have a reply.Overall, it's a marvelous movie, a lesson in acting, directing, writing, and shooting. The recent updated version has been made politically correct but is not an improvement over this original. See it if you have the chance.",

Eleven of them vote \"guilty\" but Fonda holds out for \"not guilty.\" The story is about him slowly convincing everyone else to see things his way. There are lots of familiar faces from the '50s: Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, etc. They are all interesting.Good for one look. As with most movies with political leanings (this one, All The Kings Men, The Manchurian Candidate, etc.) Hollywood is always ready for re-makes where Liberal causes are far more pronounced than they are in these classic movies. Only in the twisted mind of Liberals are we to have more sympathy for the criminal than the victim. Only in Hollywood are the defense attorneys always the good guys and movies end like this where nobody ever goes to jail!",

        "text": "As the film opens we see the inside of a court room; the evidence has already been put to the jurors and the judge is reminding them of their solemn duty... the twelve of them must reach a unanimous verdict and a guilty verdict will mean an automatic death sentence for the accused. The way the jurors talk as they enter the jury room it sounds like an open and shut case; they call for a quick vote before any discussions take place; eleven men say he is guilty, but one dissents. Juror Eight explains that he doesn't necessarily believe that the accused, an eighteen year old slum boy, is innocent but he won't allow him to be executed without the jurors even discussing the evidence. On the face of it the evidence is compelling; the accused bought a knife just like the murder weapon a couple of weeks previously, the woman across the railway line says she looked out of the window and saw the killing, the man below says he heard the accused shout 'I'm going to kill you' before hearing the body fall and seeing the accused leave the building. Gradually they look at each piece of evidence in turn and as doubts are raised the number of 'not guilties' increases but some jurors are adamant that they just know he did it; to get an acquittal prejudices must be overcome too.Set almost entirely within the confines of the jury room this film is rightfully considered a classic; it may not contain any action but it is taut from start to finish. The fact that we haven't seen any of the trial means the viewer must rely on what the jurors say to decide whether or not they think the accused is guilty and for the whole time they are deliberating we don't even know their names. The cast of twelve do a great job playing each of the very different characters; obviously Henry Fonda stands out as he is the best known actor and plays the man arguing against the majority but each of the others also put in fine performances; especially Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley who play the two jurors most determined to bring in a guilty verdict. The way some of the evidence is questioned in the jury room in a way that it was never questioned in court may be a little unlikely... especially the incident with the second knife but it isn't too far fetched and that particular moment is a brilliant piece of theatre that anybody who watches the film will remember for years afterwards. This is one of those films that everybody should see at least once.",

Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques.

        "text": "This movie, currently ranked as #21 all time on the IMDb list, is a simple story of the deliberations of 12 men on a jury of a murder trial. We see nothing of the actual trial or the closing arguments. The story begins as the judge instructs the jury, in weighing the evidence presented, they must return a verdict of 'guilty' unless there is reasonable doubt. Although not made clear in the movie, a verdict of \"not guilty\" is not the same as 'innocent.' Not guilty simply means that the prosecution did not present a case strong enough to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The case that we do not see or hear of first hand involves a son accused of murdering his father. One witness was an elderly man who claimed to have seen the boy running down the stairs from the apartment a few seconds after hearing voices and a body hitting the floor. Was this old man who shuffled along really able to get there in time? Could he really hear clearly over the noise of the passing train? Another was a woman who identified the boy as the one plunging the knife into the victim. But did she wear glasses, and did she have them on when she claimed she saw the murder 60 feet away through the windows of a passing train on elevated tracks (the 'el')? First seated the jurors take a vote, and it is 11 to one in favor of conviction. There is a ball game that evening and many of the men are anxious to delivered a verdict and get home. One man (Henry Fonda) says he is not sure, the boy may in fact be guilty, but suppose he isn't. He just wants to talk about it. A boy's life is at stake. Don't they owe it to him to examine all possibilities? But the other 11 at first look upon their task as one to convince the lone juror that he is wrong.As the 90 minutes move along, various jurors bring up points that they noticed, possibilities that neither the prosecution nor the defense attorneys had brought up. Others gradually join the 'not guilty' side, until it is only one for 'guilty.' Then there were none. Much of the dialog brought out prejudices certain men held, that were clouding their reasoning, and preventing them from seeing both sides of the argument. This is a story less about jury verdicts, and more about human nature.The movie sets out to show that with reasonable doubt at hand, a verdict of 'not guilty' must be returned. Thus it is mostly an examination of how our personal prejudice can cloud our judgment. I suspect that this story was much more significant 50 years ago than it is today. There have been a number of very public trials (e.g. OJ Simpson) where most of the evidence appeared to point to guilt, but a jury returned a 'not guilty' verdict because of reasonable doubt. However it remains part of the foundation of our legal system, that a person is innocent until proved guilty, even if it means some guilty persons will go free.Although only Lee J. Cobb stands out, as the angry juror who was the last hold out, this contained a fine ensemble cast. Martin Balsam, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Ed Begley are others who are prominent in my mind.",

        "text": "It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is. It's a nifty movie that has deservedly stayed firm through the decades, not showing its age bad at all.",

As a DVD, however, in any of the excellent versions marketed by M-G-M, 12 Angry Men comes across as an engrossing and tense drama that keeps the viewer's eyes fixed on the TV screen for every second of its 95 minutes. Why the difference? Simply the movie's genesis in a TV play and the rigid intention of producers Rose and Fonda to keep strictly within the play's one-room setting, aside from a brief prologue and epilogue, and an inconsequential scene in a washroom. As a TV play, 12 Angry Men is such an expertly crafted drama, it justifiably ranks as one of the best ever presented. As a movie, however, it's close to a no-show.I wonder how many of its thousands of ecstatic admirers have actually seen 12 Angry Men presented in a real cinema on a real 1.85:1 theater screen? Including me, it's my guess you could count that number on your fingers. The picture just doesn't work half as effectively on a cinema screen. It's too confined. True, it still has some emotional highs, mostly due to the very clever interpretations by both Jack Warden and Joseph Sweeney, who contrive to steer a charismatic middle course between the stridently way over-the-top yelling and screaming by Begley and Cobb and the frozen-faced, overly unemotional Fonda, Klugman, Webber and Voskevec. Actually, on a theater screen, Warden actually comes across with much greater impact than he does on TV. In a cinema, he and Sweeney play the characters with whom audiences most identify. Fonda seems too cold. Yet on TV, he's perfect! True, hats-off reviews ensured the movie sold a lot of tickets, but theater patrons were often disappointed.",

Cobb steals the film with an outstanding performance as a hateful juror who allows his personal problems with an alienated son to feel that the accused is guilty. Ditto for Jack Warden, who really switched his vote in order to get to that baseball game.When viewing E.G. Marshall's performance, I could not help think back about his acting in the television series-\"The Defenders.\" He is really the opposite hereEd Begley really spews out bigoted ideas that most of \"these people\" aren't any good and think nothing of a life. We are constantly reminded about the downtrodden, the abused child, slum and poverty living in relation to crime and other factors. The film is really a good psychological-sociological drama if anything.It seems as though the violent thunderstorm signaled a break in the action. When the lights were put on, the fan worked. Why didn't someone in the court tell the jurors about the fan and the light? Especially, as it was a sweltering day.As the jury foreman, Martin Balsam is supposed to conduct the agenda in order. Instead, he really allows the other jurors to dominate.Wouldn't you love to see the reaction in court when the verdict was read? How did the accuse react? The judge? The courtroom spectators?",

Everything about this film is perfect, and if there's one film that literally everybody should be obliged to watch at least once in his/her lifetime, I think it ought to be this one. The original story by Reginal Rose is wondrously absorbing, intelligent, intense and still incredibly relevant even after 60 years. Rose's own adaptation into a movie screenplay is also amazing, with not a single word or piece of dialogue too much or too few. The ensemble cast exists of twelve hyper-professional actors that each give away one of the most impeccable performances of their careers; most notable Henry Fonda as the humane hero, Lee J. Cobb as the dogmatic narcissist and E.G. Marshall as the rigorous pundit. But the biggest geniuses remain director Sidney Lumet and his cameraman Boris Kaufman.

In the United States, the verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous one way or the other. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse and ends with the jury's final instructions before retiring, a brief final scene on the courthouse steps and two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, the entire movie takes place in the jury room. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room, having been admonished that the defendant is innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Eleven of the jurors vote for conviction, each for reasons of his own. The sole holdout is Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. As Fonda persuades the weary jurors to re-examine the evidence, we learn the backstory of each man. Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a bullying self-made man, has estranged himself from his own son. Juror #7 (Jack Warden) has an ingrained mistrust of foreigners; so, to a lesser extent, does Juror #6 (Edward Binns). Jurors #10 (Ed Begley) and #11 (George Voskovec), so certain of the infallibility of the Law, assume that if the boy was arrested, he must be guilty. Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) is an advocate of dispassionate deductive reasoning. Juror #5 (Jack Klugman), like the defendant a product of \"the streets,\" hopes that his guilty vote will distance himself from his past. Juror #12 (Robert Webber), an advertising man, doesn't understand anything that he can't package and market. And Jurors #1 (Martin Balsam), #2 (John Fiedler) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney), anxious not to make waves, \"go with the flow.\" The excruciatingly hot day drags into an even hotter night; still, Fonda character,Juror #8 chips away at the guilty verdict, insisting that his fellow jurors bear in mind those words \"reasonable doubt.\"This is a classic film wherein where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language.Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.Sidney Lumet,who is in his directorial debut,effectively modulates the drama without ever taking the camera out of the jury room until the verdict is in and the jury is out.As for the story,it was mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods as it presents a powerful impact to the viewer.",

That way there's some action, and often the movement is expressive of how the juror feels about the deliberations. No doubt about it, the cast is a powerhouse of familiar faces from that period. Some low-key their performance, like Fonda, Balsam, and Klugman; others are familiar loud- mouths, like Begley and Cobb. So is the kid guilty or not. If so, it's 10,000 volts in the Big House. Besides, it doesn't help the kid that he's a poor minority, at least in the minds of some jurors. No doubt about it, for better or worse, there's a basically liberal sentiment at work in the screenplay.As the script shows, most of the guys just want to get back to their routines even though a lot's at stake. Besides, the evidence appears open and shut. So, on first ballot, it's 11 for guilty and just 1 for not (Fonda). What is he, a trouble-maker or something. No. He just thinks the evidence is not as damning as first appears, and they all need to examine it more closely. Good thing he's not running for office. Showing how the 11 get eventually whittled down to 0 is what the movie's about. In the process, some like Begley and Cobb reveal a lot about their private selves, while others are simply open to the doubts that begin to open up.The deck is somewhat stacked in terms of likability. The biggest holdouts for guilty are the least likable, except Juror #4 (Marshall) who operates on logic alone. Fortunately, Fonda's low-key, reasonable manner is not off-putting as a know-it-all; instead, he's mainly a catalyst sparking contributions from others. I guess my only reservation is with giving the jury only two choicesâ€”\"guilty\" or \"not guilty\". Seems to me, on the basis of the evidence, the proper conclusion would be \"not proved\", since the kid may well have done it. However, the evidence does not prove that he did, at least not beyond the metric of \"reasonable doubt\". All in all, a nice plot twist.Anyway, the movie's a showcase of ensemble acting that rivets audience interest despite the limitations in staging. Too bad it wasn't recognized at the time as the classic it is.",

        "text": "This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",

        "text": "12 Angry Men is directed by Sidney Lumet and adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The cast is headed by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or innocence of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. Except for two short scenes at the beginning and end of the film, it's filmed entirely on one set, that of the jury deliberation room.Sweaty, gritty, claustrophobic - all words that sit snugly in the context of Lumet's excellently crafted deconstruction of 12 men trying to arrive at one verdict in the case of a Puerto Rican youth on trial for the murder of his father. The evidence appears overwhelming, there's witnesses, a murder weapon and motive, the boy is surely on his way to the electric chair. 11 of the men are convinced he's guilty, only one man stands alone, Henry Fonda's juror number 8, who refuses to turn in a vote of guilty until the evidence and facts are discussed at length. As the others rail against him and tempers get frayed, juror number 8 prompts the others to examine their own prejudices and commitment to justice.A lesson in tight direction and editing, and with performances to match, 12 Angry Men is quite simply not to be missed by those seeking to venture into classic cinema. 9/10",

        "text": "Having seen the film before, we decided to take another look recently when it showed up on a cable channel. This Sidney Lumet 1957 film still packs a lot of power, even though times have changed in the way our justice system works. The screen play by Reginald Rose shows his brilliant insight into human beings that are called to sit as jurors in a murder case.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you don't want to read any further.It's 1957 when this case goes to court. We watch the accused man staring toward the panel in whose hands his fate rests. The jury is all male. We get to know that a public defendant was appointed to defend the accused man. We realize he hasn't done a great job, as most of the men in the jury room are convinced this boy is guilty before he has been proved innocent.We watch as the men are settling into their chairs around the deliberating table, and how a juror is standing by the window looking toward the streets below, lost in thought. It's stifling in the room. Those were the days of not having air conditioned all over, so these men are sweating in the uncomfortable room during one of the worst days of the summer.As the men proceed to have a preliminary vote, juror number eight casts a 'not guilty' vote that shocks the room. How dare he go against the majority? Who is he to stand in the way of what seems to be an open and shut case? This guy is guilty! Thus begins the deliberations in which all these men bring their own prejudices and biases to determine if the boy will go to the electric chair, which by all appearances, seems to be the case here. It's because of one decent man that doesn't mind facing the rest that we get to know why the accused couldn't have done the murder the authorities say he committed. In the process the jurors will get to understand the meaning of justice.This drama owes Henry Fonda a debt of gratitude. We can't think of any other actor playing this juror. Mr. Fonda exudes kindness and he is the only person in the room that is not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt the boy has killed his own father. Not only did he make a contribution as an actor, but also helped produced the movie.Lee J. Cobb, one of the great American actors of the last century, is seen as a juror that sees in the accused young man his own estranged son, who he hasn't seen in a couple of years, having left home because of the conflict with the old man. Mr. Cobb is just the opposite of Mr. Fonda, and he gives an intense performance to show us this man in turmoil. The rest of the cast is wonderful. Each one has his own moment to shine.There is not a single moment that rings false in the movie. In reading a couple of comments about \"12 Angry Men\", some people marvel there were no women in the jury, or that the accused man's case hasn't been presented by the defense attorney in a more effective way. We have to remember first of all, the times in which the action takes place, and the fact that being a poor man, the accused man has been given an attorney who was obviously not interested in his defense. The young man being from a minority migrant group didn't elicit sympathy from these jurors, at all, which might have been the prosecution's goal in going along with the selection.This is a movie that should be seen by anyone serving in a jury in a court of justice. Mr. Lumet and Mr. Rose have created a timeless film that will be the standard in which everything else is judged.",

        "text": "Brilliant film version of the televised play, scripted by the plays' author Reginald Rose, and produced by Rose and leading actor Henry Fonda. It's fascinating and compelling, offering memorable showcases to an amazing ensemble. The basic story is solid, but more than that, it's a nice look into a rich variety of characters, each with their own background and reasoning. It's all the more impressive for being a young Sidney Lumets' filmmaking debut; he makes this a highly charged, atmospheric experience.An 18 year old teenager is on trial for murder, and the jury has retired to discuss the case. When things start out, 11 men are ready to convict the boy, and there's one holdout, juror no. eight (Fonda); Fonda doesn't necessarily believe the boy is innocent, but he's passionate in his belief that there's enough *reasonable doubt* in the matter to refrain from voting guilty. He encounters a fair amount of hostility at first, particularly from the excitable juror no. three (Lee J. Cobb), but as the night falls and a storm starts up, he wears down his fellow men a bit at a time, insisting on bringing up facts that he felt weren't adequately explained during the trail.What's so wonderful about \"12 Angry Men\" is how believable it all is, right down to one juror, the baseball loving juror no. seven (Jack Warden) being willing to change his vote just to get the hell out of there, and the earnest juror no. 11 (George Voskovec) admonishing him for not doing this for the *right* reason. Each actor gets their own chance in the spotlight, and they're all superb. Cobb has the most intense role as a truly stubborn man who's gotten himself personally involved in the case; Ed Begley is equally potent as juror no. 10, another holdout. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, and Robert Webber fill out the rest of this powerhouse cast.While the story is quite good dramatically, it's not without some humour, some of it coming from adman Webber. Use of music is sparing, which only adds a sense of realism to the proceedings. One of the most striking moments is when most of the group turns their backs to Begley after he launches into a rather disconcerting rant.Overall, this does deserve to be considered one of the finest American films of all time. It keeps the viewer riveted every step of the way.10 out of 10.",

        "text": "TWELVE ANGRY MEN is essentially a claustrophobic slice of jury duty, where jurors are herded into a New York City courtroom to discuss the facts of a murder trial of a boy accused of murdering his father.Gradually, with stark close-ups of sweating faces, we get to know the men after a brief round of small talk leads to the small details of the case after choosing a jury foreman (MARTIN BALSAM).Most of these fine actors are gone now, but interestingly enough the three who played the angriest men (LEE J. COBB, E.G. MARSHALL and ED BEGLEY) all died of heart attack several years after filming this one. HENRY FONDA, as the man who carefully reconstructs what might have happened, had a long screen career that ended after winning an Oscar for ON GOLDEN POND.Based on a TV play directed by Sidney Lumet, it's a faithful retelling of the tale, photographed with stark realism that catches the sweaty courtroom on a hot summer day and is basically a character study of each man, each one put under the microscope by a shrewd director who gets the most from his players.The tension builds from the disagreements that arise over deliberations until the final struggle to reach a decision depends on the vote of the one stubborn hold-out (LEE J. COBB). Fonda is the man who presents his own theory of what actually happened and is able to persuade the others, one by one, to his side of the argument.Extremely well done drama seems almost documentary in its display of jury room deliberations when tempers flash, where patience is strained and reason finally sees the light of day after Fonda (never convinced of the boy's guilt in killing his father) is able to present his doubts to the other jurors.

As we all know the action is virtually confined to the Jury Room in the wake of a murder trial to which we are not privy. It seems open and shut and eleven of the jurors are ready to vote guilty and get out of there but one man persuades them to at least consider the possibility that the accused is innocent. Eventually all twelve jurors vote not guilty, end of story. BUT: It they are correct then WHO did kill the victim? Presumably the police never bothered to search for anyone else so is there a murderer on the loose? Conversely, what if the accused really IS guilty, then they have conspired to let a murderer walk free. Clearly this began life as a play for television for which its single set is ideal and the transformation to the big screen is masterly. All twelve actors are beyond praise and this is, without question, a truly fine film, yet a film that tackles moral questions so forthrightly should itself be questioned by ignoring others.",

I was blown away.I saw the high rating of this movie and thought it would be good but it's a movie from 1957 so how good are we talking. Then as the movie started I see 12 white male jurors go into jury chambers to decide the fate of either an Italian or Latino teen. Instantly, I thought, \"I'm going to hate this movie.\" And as the subtle and not so subtle personality traits and ideologies of some of the men became known I thought, \"I'm really going to hate this movie.\"But not so fast my fine movie-going friend. The 1950's just may be able to surprise you. And that it did. This movie about the American justice system and the power of jurors who take justice seriously is a tremendous tribute and example of what justice should be.The entire unfolding of the movie was so realistic: the yelling, the arguing, the soapbox preaching, the prejudices, the practical, the impractical, the logical, the emotional, those who cared, those who couldn't careless, it was flat out real. They couldn't have done a better job with the characters, the writing, and the acting. 12 jurors in a stuffy jury room deliberating upon the fate of a man accused of murder and one man upsetting the balance--you can imagine the fury, frustration, impatience, misunderstanding, and impertinence.

Lots of later movies tried to imitate it and attempted to reach the same level of successful and brilliance but none of them have even come close yet.It also has one of the most simple premises out there. All that the movie is about is 12 jurors trying to decide whether or not the accused in a murder-trial is guilty of the crime or not. So the movie is all talk but sure no bore. It's a movie that is always going and at all times interesting, due to its diverse and rich characters and its simple, yet greatly intriguing concept. I have no illusions about it though that this is also how its like in real life. So even though the movie takes a realistic approach with its story, it's still obviously fiction but at least it's not overwritten or ever exaggerated.Interesting and most effective thing about the movie is that it starts off with only one guy voting for the accused being not guilty, even though he himself is not at all convinced that he is actually innocent. He only wants to talk about it because he feels like he owes it to the guy, who's life they are deciding about. All are reluctant at first, since it seemed to be a clear and done case but the more elements and proof gets debated about the more doubt arises about his guilt. So slowly opinions start to slide and some of the jurors get set up against each other, due to their different opinions. Its what keeps the movie so interesting to watch and is also what makes the movie a real well flowing well.It's also brilliantly brought to the screen by director Sidney Lumet, who had never directed a theatrical movie before actually. Even though the movie is set in mostly one room he uses this aspect to the maximum and to the movie its own advantage. It gives the movie a great atmosphere and feel to it. There are some long and dynamic shots, that allow all of the characters to often do their say in a sequences. It gives the characters actually some depth and personality, even though we never get to know all of their names and of course it's not being the type of movie that has the space and time to do some character building. Sidney Lumet really did the most and best with the story and its characters.It's obviously a character drive movie and in a way also a real great character study. So it also really helps the movie that it has some truly great actors in it. I was a bit worried about Henry Fonda being what was supposed to be the most sympathetic character, also since I was used to seeing Jack Lemmon in that role, in the 1997 remake. But no, Fonda was just surprisingly great and effective in his role. Lee J. Cobb was also really great but by saying that I feel like I'm not given the rest of the cast enough credit. All are simply great in their roles, though it are Fonda and Cobb that stand out, also because they are being the main characters of the movie, that throughout stand opposite to each other with their views and opinions. It's were most of the movie its fireworks comes from.One great and fantastically effective minimalistic and simplistic movie.

One man stands against the rest and argues that he may not be. In the 90 minutes that follow, this goes into these twelve individuals, and we see how peer pressure and personal prejudices can sway decisions that ought not to be taken lightly. This is a masterpiece, and it is so on account of all the elements being carefully crafted, each excellent on their own, and the mix of them all being so seamless. Every character(they are the focus of this, if the well thought out case itself does get a lot of attention as well) and the script is well-written, developed impeccably and credible. This is quite realistic, and what flaws there are were possibly conscious decisions for the dramatic effect(it is not a documentary, nor was it meant to be), and do not take away from the whole. The acting is perfect for all concerned. This is carried by dialog and marvelous speeches, with no flashbacks and essentially only one setting(albeit the cinematography makes full use of it, so no claustrophobia is induced). The camera stays on the people, follows them, remains on them for reactions when someone else suddenly speaks, and there are long takes. Editing is impossibly subtle. You forget that it's a movie. Instead, you find yourself experiencing this tense situation with them. A dozen men in a locked room, determining if someone lives or dies. This raises questions about the legal system, as well. Other than Serpico, I haven't seen anything by Lumet, but Dog Day Afternoon is on my list of ones to get. There is some mildly disturbing content and a few instances of moderate language in this. The DVD comes with the original trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10",

        "text": "... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states not guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not \"set up\" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E.G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",

I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.Grade: A+",

But the question still remains: Was the defendant innocent or guilty? Though undeniably well directed and acted, with an engrossing narrative, the one flaw is the Fonda juror, who is just insufferably sanctimonious! His argument of \"It's Possible.\" to argue reasonable doubt is absurd, since if taken to its logical conclusion, would never lead to a conviction, since \"it's possible\" that it was the evil twin, or \"it's possible\" that it was paranormal in some way! It's more a study of how one strong-willed man can persuade weaker-willed men to his way of thinking, which does not inherently mean a morally just outcome! Still, a compelling film that does provoke much thought and argument, and can't be so easily dismissed, though it is overpraised.",

The earlier film is quite a show piece for acting talent and all acquit themselves admirably whilst it was undoubtedly a marvellous launch pad for the director's career.",

        "text": "This is a courtroom drama with a difference; we see nothing of the actual trial except the end of the judge's summing up. We only get a brief glimpse of the defendant, a young man accused of stabbing to death his abusive father. We do not see the lawyers or any of the witnesses. The action is confined to the jury room after the trial has finished. At first, eleven jurors believe that the defendant is guilty but one, played by Henry Fonda, has doubts, and tries to convince his colleagues that the case has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.The remarkable thing about this film is that each of the twelve jurymen (all are male) emerges as an individual in his own right. Thanks are due to Vukodlak whose helpful review accurately summarises their characters. The jurors are referred to by their jury numbers, not their names, although we discover the surnames of Henry Fonda's character Number 8 (Davis) and of his colleague Number 9 (McCardle) right at the end. Number 8 is the key character. At first he is somewhat hesitant in his views. He is not convinced of the boy's innocence, and perhaps, at first, not even of the reasonable doubt about his guilt that would justify bringing in a \"not guilty\" verdict. He is, however, unwilling to condemn a young man to the electric chair without close consideration of all the issues, and suggests that the jury should take its time to talk the matter over. As they do, each piece of evidence is subjected to close scrutiny, the reliability of witnesses is cast into doubt, and holes start to emerge in what had previously seemed a watertight prosecution case. One by one the more conscientious members of the jury, with one exception, start to come over to Number 8's point of view.Four other jurors play particularly important parts in the drama. Number 7, played by Jack Warden, is the least conscientious of all. He is not worried in the least about the defendant's guilt or innocence. He has tickets for a baseball game that evening and wants to reach a verdict as quickly as possible so that he does not miss the match. At first he votes to find the defendant guilty, but when he sees how things are going he abruptly changes his vote to not guilty in order to get home more quickly. (He is deservedly rebuked by Number 11, a painstaking, foreign-born watchmaker).Number 4, played by E. G. Marshall, is the exception mentioned above, the one juror who approaches his duties conscientiously but who nevertheless holds out for a guilty verdict almost to the very end. He is a stockbroker by profession, clearly something of an intellectual. He approaches the case calmly, logically and methodically, weighing every piece of evidence. The problem is that his approach takes no account of the emotions involved and leaves no room for doubt. As one of the other jurors says, weighing up evidence is not a precise science, but Number 4 treats it as though it is. When convinced by Number 8's arguments, however, he concedes with good grace that there is now reasonable doubt in his mind and changes his vote to not guilty.Number 10 and Number 3, although Number 4's allies, are completely different in their approach to the case. Whereas he approaches it with too much scientific detachment, they approach it with too much passion and prejudice. Number 10, played by Ed Begley, is prejudiced against the young man because of his social background. In a memorable scene he gives vent to his feelings in a long rant about \"those people\"; this could mean slum dwellers in general or could be a racist diatribe. (The defendant's ethnicity is never precisely established). One by one the other jurors, even those who have previously supported him, turn their backs on him. Number 3 is as violent in his feelings as Number 10, but his hatred of the young man arises less from social or racial prejudice than from his resentment of his own son, from whom he is estranged.All of the parts are very well played, including the calm, authoritative Fonda. The best, however, was Lee J Cobb as Number 3. Whereas Begley's character is simply contemptible, Cobb's is, in a way, pitiable. He is full of anger, but we see that his anger arises out of the anguish caused by his failed relationship with his own son. This is, in fact, one of those rare films where everything works perfectly- the script, the acting and Sidney Lumet's direction which emphasises the claustrophobic atmosphere of the jury room and the tension of the plot. (Lumet is one of a select band of directors who have made a masterpiece with their first film). The result is a true classic of the cinema, the greatest-ever legal drama and one of the greatest films of all time. It did not do well at the Oscars, but that is because it had the misfortune to come out in the same year as another great film, \"Bridge on the River Kwai\".Unlike some, I did not see the film as reflecting a preference for liberal political values over conservative ones; a belief in the importance of the presumption of innocence is not confined to liberals. Also, I did not see it necessarily as a vindication of the jury system. At the end of the film we feel a sense of relief that a possible miscarriage of justice has been averted, but we are also left with an uneasy feeling that, in real life, innocent people may have been convicted because their juries contained too many Wardens, Cobbs or Begleys and not enough Fondas. 10/10",

        "text": "Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is an interesting choice for one of the greatest American films of all time given its simultaneous abstraction and straight-forwardness as a film. It concerns a group of twelve jurors who are retired to reach a verdict on a murder case involving an eighteen-year-old living in the slums of New York, who is accused of murdering his father at their home. We are immediately taken into the New York City courthouse, where the twelve jurors are sent to their private room to discuss the case and come to a unanimous vote in favor of life or death for the boy. All but one juror is positive beyond a reasonable doubt that the boy in question is guilty and deserves the chair for his crimes.The man is Henry Fonda's character, a man who, like all but one other soul in the room, remains nameless until the end of the film. While he doesn't entirely believe the boy's innocence, he is unsure that he is guilty and feels it is wrong to jump to a decision about a young life so quickly without at least talking over the facts. With that, the jurors are forced to divulge some sort of conversation to get on the same page in favor of one side or the other. During this time, the New York City heat is sweltering, the fan in the room isn't working, and one juror cannot wait until he is released so he can go to a baseball game in the evening. What would normally be a quick meeting between twelve men turns into a bitter, but rational display or exchanging facts about the case and going against groupthink by providing logical alternatives to the events recounted by the witnesses.Fonda's character is called a lot of things in the film and many of them are accurate to his persona, albeit in a bitter, shortchanging manner. He is referred to as a \"golden boy,\" sympathizing a young boy in the slums who has ostensibly taken on a life of savagery if he is in fact guilty. His character basically recites the same dialog repeatedly throughout the film, stating how he is not totally sure if he indeed not guilty, but can't be certain that he is guilty, leaving a reasonable doubt on his mind that he is too ethical to override.One of the many intriguing things about Fonda's stance is his ability to go against the grain; the slightest doubt in his mind, at first, the commonality of the boy's alleged murder-weapon, a pocketknife, leads him to stall an otherwise unanimously convinced jury that the boy on trial is guilty. How many people, even if they had the slightest doubt in their mind, would challenge eleven other men who have raised their hands in favor of the boy's guilt and subsequent death? Most people, including myself probably, would bury our skepticism under our own volition of self-deprecation: \"maybe I missed something,\" we'd think, \"maybe I'm just way off,\" we'd add, before humbly raising our hand in a delayed fashion to make what looked to be a hung jury a unanimous vote. If Fonda's character would've done that, 12 Angry Men would be a depressingly common and pointless short film; not one of the greatest works of American cinema.The key to the film's renowned qualities lies in a few places. As stated, the first is the plausibility to believe the jurors become wrong-headed once they begin agreeing with Fonda's character. Some would argue that having these characters basing an entire trial/murder on the happenings of scattered incidents that were relatively minor in the grand-scheme would result in a miscarriage of justice. Film critic Mike D'Angelo says that these twelve jurors would probably be the same ones who would acquit O.J. Simpson of his murder charges. The fact is, we don't know at the end of it; we weren't there, we were never destined to be there, and all we know is that one person is dead, one person is about to own or disown responsibility to that death, and there is reasonable doubt lingering in the room like fragrant cologne. The correctness or morality of the jurors' decision isn't so much in question, for I'm sure a dinner conversation between two people who viewed the film disagreeing with the jurors' decisions could indeed occur with both parties having enough well-founded evidence.This brings me to the other noteworthy element about the film, which is its ability to operate in several different genres. The attributes of the film I just mentioned, leading it to be discussed and interpreted in a number of different ways, makes it a biting mystery, while the rapid-fire, investigative dialog in the second and third act turns the film more in the direction of a suspense film or a crime-drama. Finally, there's the inherent melodrama of character relations, with numerous not getting along with one another and the hard-headedness of other jurors standing in the way in preventing what could be a potential miscarriage of justice (Ed Begley's character, for example, who remains incorruptibly certain that the boy is guilty).Finally, above all in some minds, there's the sheer entertainment value of 12 Angry Men. This is a film that further proves my point that a film that takes place in one room and is heavily built on character relations and character development can be just as gripping as a film predicated upon large action setpieces and costly displays of action. As droll as the film may seem, this is one of the most entertaining courtroom-dramas I've yet to see with some of the most ambiguous questions about rebelling against groupthink, the analysis of justice and legal practices, and the sheer impact and significance of reasonable doubt(s) I have ever seen.",

It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of \"reasonable doubts\", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it! 10/10",

The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role.

        "text": "It would not have been possible to have made Schindler's List immediately after World War II. The public was just taking in the magnitude of the Holocaust, they might not have believed it. Fortunately for the prosecutors at Nuremberg and for history the Nazis being the anal retentives that they were, made these incredibly meticulous records which scholars and historians have sifted through and we have the whole thing incredibly documented by the perpetrator's own hand. With a fifty year perspective now and the very existence of the state of Israel questioned by those who ought to know better, Steven Spielberg has given us a work for the ages.If you can sit through two incredibly long and sorrowful films one ought to see Schindler's List back to back with The Diary Of Anne Frank. In the latter film, we see a very ordinary group of people fighting for survival to escape the fate of what we see happened to so many. The fact they were days from possible liberation makes the sorrow of that film all the more poignant.Schindler's List is a story of escape from the ultimate fate of six million. Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson is a German businessman who sees a chance at some nice war profits using some incredibly cheap labor from the concentration camps. He's willing to start a factory in occupied Poland with slave labor Jews. Towards that end he hears of a man who ran a factory among the Jews in the newly formed Cracow ghetto, Itzak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Kingsley agrees to work for him and with him recruiting the labor force, Neeson gets his factory going. With that comes responsibility for these people. He fights for them, the original ones and some added to his growing work force. Over the over 3 hour film, Neeson gradually changes and his concern for his charges becomes humanitarian. He plays a dangerous game, especially with concentration camp commandant Ralph Fiennes. A man who delights in the total power he's been handed and the liberation from all civilized restraints to exercise barbarism, arbitrary and capricious. Fiennes will chill you with his penultimate portrayal of a perfect Nazi.Let us not forget that Schindler himself was a Nazi. He did in fact in the end go broke in paying out bribes for special consideration for his charges that meant their very lives. It's also possible that he saw the way the war would end and that those responsible for the Holocaust would be held accountable. Some have speculated that he did this for no other reason than to bank credit with possible witnesses. If that was the case it certainly worked because he was investigated and not charged with any war crimes.Still I'd prefer to believe the testimony of those on the scene including the real life Itzak Stern. Those are the folks that ought to know.Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. It deserved every honor it got and I only wish Neeson and Fiennes were winners as well.It's a film about the Holocaust, but it's also a film about the results of dehumanization of a people and when the state completes the process of dehumanization what can be the result. I'm not sure what future work Steven Spielberg has planned, but he can't top this no way, no how.",

Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds.

        "text": "\"Schindler's List\" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1993 that won Best Picture that year and took home another six Oscars including one for director Steven Spielberg, for whom it is probably still his career-defining work and with everything that he has under his belt like Jaws, Indiana Jones and much more, this means quite something. This film we have here runs for over 3 hours and I was lucky enough today to catch it on the big theater screen on the occasion of a very special day here in Germany. And what can I say. It was a feast. If that is an appropriate term given the heavy subject. I already wrote in the title of my review that this is of course a movie about the Holocaust. And it does not even try to hide the horrible deeds done by the perpetrators back then. Which means you have several occasions where you see people being shot in the head from the nearest distance and killed in cold blood for what their religion is. But it is also an uplifting movie as the man in the middle of it is Oskar Schindler, a manufacturer who saved more than a thousand Jewish lives during these perhaps darkest days in German (global) history. He is played by Liam Neeson and this is also his career-defining performance today without a doubt. Ralph Fiennes was around the age of 30 when he played the main antagonist here, Amon Göth, and Ben Kingsley, already an Oscar winner back then, is also on board and he looks so different compared to how he looks today, almost older you could say.By the way I did not know this film was based on a book in fact. It's really been a long long time since first time I saw it. But it is as good 25 years after its release as it was back then when I watched it for the first time. I must say I was not too touched throughout the movie as I hoped I could be and as I know many others were, but the last 20 minutes or so are heart-breaking stuff. I am talking about the moment when Schindler starts talking to his \"employees\", the guards I mean with that, as well as the Jews when he says he will be the hunted from now on. And then there is this powerful march with the haunting music at the very end before the film switches into the now, well into the early 1990s you must say, and we see the survivors, the Schindler Jews, and their offspring too and this idea of how Schindler did not only save these men, but saved entire generations and future children is so incredibly touching that there is no way your eyes won't get wet. I think my entire cinema could have finished drought in Africa when the closing credits rolled in. And lets not forget John Williams' beautiful beautiful soundtrack / main theme that is among the saddest tunes you will ever hear during a film and I know now already it is one that will never leave my head and ears. It was probably before watching this film the one thing that I have come across many times over the last years/decade and which I remembered better than anything else from this film.I was also glad to see parents with their children in the audience today, kids that were not even close to being born in 1993, so the film's message is carried on to the next generation. Well, what can I say. The Holocaust subject here in Germany is one that is very dominant today also in modern culture and there are constantly new exhibitions about this topic and also many new films still being made. And not just in Germany obviously. But I am pretty sure that none of these will ever reach the icon status of Schindler's List. Other really touching moments for me included the moment Kingsley calls the list something like \"ultimate goodness\", when we see earlier on the shoes and jewellery taken from Jews before their journey into destruction, the dead girl in the red dress etc. The latter is one you could talk about for ages and write an entire review about in my opinion. What is her significance? Well.. I would say this only use of color before the jump forward in time near the end is intended to emphasize that there is an individual human being behind every face and even if they don't stand out thanks to shining garments, we still should not forget that. Be it the one-armed men, the woman who knew so much about construction or everybody resting down there below Göth's balcony. They all have their stories and their loved ones and they all should not have died. It is very difficult in the presence of these sheer numbers of Jews being killed back then, but we shall not forget every one of them deserved to live. And every one of them has their own story. If we lose our empathy and become numb to what happened, then all is lost. And it is merely numbers that mean nothing to us.Okay, I mentioned Göth already. Fiennes was nominated for an Oscar for that portrayal and many today say he should have won instead of Tommy Lee Jones, but not having seen the latter's movie, I will not discuss that in detail. But I think it is a surprising loss, even with TLJ having the momentum given how much they loved Schindler's List. Like with the scene I mentioned some lines above, I also think that Göth could have deserved his own review. It is so difficult to say what this character is and what he is not. There is no 100% description, it is all about the shades. Very fitting the house keeper's description that you never knew what would happen next with him and how you could calm him down. Is he an opportunist? A sadist? A psychopath? A racist? Probably yes to all that, but then there are these moments when deep down inside him he has affections for the Jewish housekeeper before reality bites and he starts attacking her violently. The scene when he tells Schindler that he wants to take her with him is telling enough, only to say he should shoot her in the head in the nearest forest. Maybe this is the closest he can get to love? Tough to say. The relationship between Göth and Schindler is also interesting. I do think he looks up to Schindler for his success with women, his whole aura, his talent to entertain and he wants to be like him instead of being an alcoholic and gambling addict. Not many would have gotten away with the hose scene really, but Schindler does with the high-profile Nazis trying desperately to convince themselves that he is just torturing the Jews in the wagons. Of course he is not and they know. But they do not have the will and charisma to oppose him. The very first scene at the table when Schindler invites the Nazis over is already very telling, who is the man in charge. But he needs them too. Without being an NSDAP member, there is no chance for him to thrive and save a single life.And finally, lets look at the character transformations. Some brief words on Göth first who believes he is some high-appointed ruler about who lives and who dies thanks to Schindler's influence. There is no real goodness in the former. It is all make-believe and when he realizes he shoots the boy in cold blood. But about Schindler, there is a lot more to say, also when it comes to his wife and of course his heartfelt final speech about how he could have saved more. At some point, it was never about prestige, about reputation or about business anymore. Let alone about money. He gives it all away for his fake factory. This is when he turns into the good human being, which also has a lot to do with Stern's influence for sure. So yeah, this is a really long movie, but oh so rewarding and also for me a definite contender for best film of 1993. Don't give up on it if greatness is not achieved on all occasions early on. What is waiting for you is absolutely worth it.Of course, due to the cruel imagery, this is not a film for the very young ones, but even if it is extremely serious and will break your heart on more than one occasion, there are also really many moments, surprisingly more than I expected where this film will make you smile. These include basically all Schindler's exchanges and interactions with women, be it the ones sitting on his desk typing or the ones who want to see him or all the other ones attracted to him and the other way around. Or one other scene that stays in the mind very much for me is when he is looking for Stern at the train station and how these resilient Nazi guards help him quickly after being worried about their own future and having fear of being sent to Russia. So yeah, there is probably at least a dozen scenes more that stay in the mind and that I could write a whole chapter about and you will recognize these scenes when you watch them or maybe you will think of completely different scenes than the ones I mean, but that is perfectly fine though. I will spare you all that. But I will not spare you the words that this is an absolute must-see from the historic and emotional perspective and unless you really really hate Holocaust movies for whatever reason, you should watch this one. Actually, even if you do, you should watch it because this is the one film that can change your mind. Go for it if you really haven't seen it so far and with that I am of course speaking in particular to the younger readers. There's a reason this is so high on the imdb top250. And rightfully so. If you are lucky enough like myself to get into a big screen showing, then do not miss out under any circumstances. A gigantic thumbs-up from me for Schindler's List.",

        "text": "History has proved that the old saying, \"God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy\", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight \"Die, Nazi, Die!\" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and \"Schindler's List\" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like \"Schindler's List\" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life \"Schindler Jews\" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.",

        "text": "As Nazi Germany invades Poland, opportunist Oscar Schindler sees a chance to open a factory serving the military and using Jews for labour.  However, as the full horror of the war on the Jewish people becomes ever more clear, Schindler's selfishness turns more into compassion for his fellowman.Having spent 10 weeks watching `Taken' and remembering just how awful Spielberg can be when he is being mushily sentimental, I revisited this film as it was showing in the build up to the TV coverage of the 2003 Oscar ceremony.  It is a powerful film simply because Spielberg manages to keep the mush out of it and just let the events speak for themselves.  When people are shot on the street there is no John Williams music or slow-motion, they simply fall in a bloody heap and the film moves on.  This makes it shockingly cold and that is the aim.The story is difficult to summarise because a surprising amount of it is spent away from the story of Schindler and on the plight of the Jews generally.  Again this theme within the narrative stops to wandering and allows it to be impacting.  True there is an element of `look what happened, isn't this terrible?' about it, but not too much.  In the final hour in particular it gets a little sentimental but not to the point of spoiling things.Neeson's Schindler makes you wonder why he wasn't able to get any character into his recent role in Star Wars I.  Here he keeps Schindler a complex man, driven by a mix of selfishness and compassion but Spielberg simplifies him a bit towards the end (but I may be being a bit picky).  Fiennes' Goeth is also wonderfully drawn.  A cold blooded killer no doubt but also not painted without his own complexities and Fiennes holds the focus whenever he is onscreen.  The support cast are all excellent right down to extras  if you think it is easy to scream and wail convincingly then you should compare this to Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones!  I never doubted that any of the actors were anything but the characters they played.Spielberg rightly won his Oscars for this and his direction is excellent. Although I do dislike him immensely when he goes all `apple pie' on us, he is great at what he does and this is one of his best films since Jaws.  A powerful, moving film that is moving for all the right reasons and not just because John Williams cranks in.  Difficult to watch but worth the effort.",

Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - \"I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word\".\"Schindler's List\" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment.

Indeed, the biggest criticism the film gets is that it came from Spielberg, well known for his sentimentality. Had another director made the same film, it would probably be considered flawless.One can wonder about the casting of Liam Neeson as a Moravian German, when he clearly is not. But with such a strong acting ability, this can be overlooked. The casting of Ben Kingsley was brilliant, even if he is not Jewish, and it is a shame this role is not the one he is best known for. Somehow Ralph Fiennes got a supporting actor nomination, but not Kingsley? The choice to film in black and white makes sense, as Spielberg wanted a \"documentary\" feel. Does the infusion of red take away from this? Some might say so.This film racked up a slew of awards, including several Oscars, and this is well-deserved. Despite its critics, this will no doubt go on to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, and easily the best to address the Holocaust.",

Set in the Nazi German concentration camps of World War II, filled with thousands of innocent Jewish people, where greedy, unsuccessful businessman Oskar Schindler (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Liam Neeson) hoping to make profit from the Jewish slave labour manufacturing. Later we are introduced to one of the lead villains, overseeing the progress of the camp, the evil Amon Goeth (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fiennes). As time goes by, more and more Jews are trying to escape capture, torture and death by the Nazis, Oskar sees how much pain and suffering these innocent souls are going through, and starts having changes in heart. So with the help of friend and almost colleague Itzhak Stern (BAFTA nominated Sir Ben Kingsley) they begin to type a list (hence the title) for all the Jews he can afford to buy and take away to another camp for a new manufacturing business. He manages to \"evacuate\" approximately 1,100 victims, and he becomes the unlikely hero (after not doing much earlier) by releasing all of them. Also starring Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler, Jonathan Sagall as Poldek Pfefferberg, Embeth Davidtz as Helen Hirsch and Malgoscha Gebel as Victoria Klonowska. There are horrific and memorable moments of realistic suffering, torture and death, a hideous real villain and a great unlikely real hero, moments of colour (i.e. the beginning, the girl with the red coat, and the ending) and a teary ending with many survivors paying their respects at Schindler's grave. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Best Sound, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture, and it was nominated for Best Original Score.

        "text": "Steven Spielberg, until the appearance of this film, was rightly noted mainly for his child's view of movies, fast action, easy sentiment, and a generally accurate sense of appeal to fantasy and wish fulfillment. He pretty much discarded that sort of innocence here, without leaving behind his appreciation of the commercial value of a story.It's impossible not to be deeply moved. The extermination program of the Nazis was the most horrific offense to human morality of the 20th century, and one of the worst in history. It wasn't the worst of the slaughters. The two world wars qualified for those honors. It wasn't even the worst example of ethnic cleansing, as it's come to be called. But more than six million Jews and more than seven million other undesirables -- homosexuals, the mentally ill, gypsies, political dissidents -- perished in the camps and not a single Jewish family in Europe went untouched. And it wasn't a war in which the victims were fighting back. It was a deliberate and very thorough act of genocide on the part of a people that Madame de Stael once described as \"a nation of poets and dreamers.\"It's a kind of \"cross-over\" movie in which the protagonist is not Jewish but rather a Christian who comes to their rescue. A basically decent man comes to his senses. This is the formula, whether the despised and abused minority are Jews or African-Americans. If it were otherwise, there would be a danger of this being seen somehow as a \"Jewish\" movie by the unenlightened masses and, as a consequence, might suffer at the box office. Better \"In the Heat of the Night\" than \"Superfly.\" But Spielberg has avoided most of the clichés associated with films of the final solution. No voice overs telling us of the suffering. No stock footage of bull dozers plowing corpses into mass graves. For the most part, the story stays at the personal level. (We hear hardly anything of the progress of the war.) And it's at this level that the film excels, due to the mature script and the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Feinnes. There are many other characters, including Embeth Davidtz.The film is good because Neason's character begins not as a racist or a humanitarian but as a moral nihilist. He cares about nothing but money and the sensory pleasures it affords. He couldn't care less about the Jews, or about the Nazis either for that matter. The war to him is just a way of making a profit using cheap labor. And the script rises above the formulaic in not giving him a moment of epiphany. At no point does his brow furrow, his eyes light up, and he thinks to himself, \"My God, what am I doing?\" Nope. Instead, his development is informed by minor but important insights distributed here and there. After the surrender, he leaves the camp as a fugitive, dressed in prison clothes, mourning his carelessness in not saving more lives.Spielberg tells the story in a straightforward way but of course some incidents and dialog from events of fifty years ago must be fabricated. And the fabrications are well done. Especially enjoyable is the touchy, sometimes abrasive, and often humorous relationship between Neason, the salesman and con man who simply has no head for business, and Ben Kingsley as the matter-of-fact accountant who does. I'd give examples of some exchanges but there isn't space.Spielberg hasn't quite gotten over his taste for easy sentimentality. There are only two touches of color in this black-and-white movie. A little girl in a rose-colored coat appears two or three times, so that we can know who it is when her body is wheeled past in a barrow, just another victim. And when the workers hold a ceremony on Shabat, the candle flames are touched with a warm orange that signifies life. Effective, yes, but unnecessary in an adult film like this. Most people watching the film may be trusted to know what's going on without being nudged. But that's small stuff. Somewhat more embarrassing is a scene in which a German officer screams like a maniac and makes gargoyle faces at the camera after emptying his pistol into a mountain of burning bodies. Are we supposed to learn from this that the people running the camps were evil? The Nazi's extermination program prompted many studies in social science, none of which has contributed much to our understanding of why this, and similar programs, seem to be so common around the world. It's easy enough to blame Germany and the SS, but what happened in Kosovo, Maylasia, Cambodia, and Rwanda? Perhaps one of the reasons we've never really understood it is that we don't want to. Perhaps the answer lies not in \"F\" (for \"facism\") scales or ideographic studies of power but in the darkest aspects of human nature itself. Is there a group of people who have nothing in common but their ethnic identity that we ourselves would enjoy seeing wiped off the map? We all have massive cerebral cortices, much of the functions of which seem devoted to damping down impulses from structures lower down on the brain that generate desires to mate, to flee from danger, and to kill things and people that get in our way. Some day science might give us an answer but until then we have to rely on poets like Robert Burns.'Many and sharp the num'rous ills Inwoven with our frame! More pointed still we make ourselves Regret, remorse, and shame! And Man, whose heav'n-erected face The smiles of love adorn, - Man's inhumanity to man Makes countless thousands mourn!",

It's still one of the most powerful stories ever put on film, mainly because it's based on fact. Since it's Hollywood, you don't know how much of this is true but the Holocaust certainly is and that's enough. The little details don't matter.This movie features extremely good acting by the three leads: Liam Neson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley. Fiennes is particularly good as the Nazi villain. He's downright scary and one of the most rotten, despicable human beings ever put on film....but that was the intent. I don't know if his character (or lack of it) was exaggerated since this was made by a famous Jewish filmmaker (Steven Spielberg) who has made the Nazis look as bad as possible in a number of his movie (not that they don't deserve it!). Nonetheless, Fiennes' portrayal of \"Amon Goeth\" is one you'll remember. You'll want to punch this idiot right in the nose.Neeson, in the title role as \"Oskar Schlinder,\" is intriguing as the industrialist who slowly sees immoral things happening that the become too repulsive for him to support. For much of the film, he still isn't a \"good guy\" but he certainly comes around and becomes a hero in the end. Neeson's scene near the conclusion when \"Schindler\" parts with \"his\" Jews at the end of the war is extremely moving. It brings tears to my eyes every time. When he agonizes that \"I could have done more,\" it is something all of us could say and probably will some day. That sentence by him haunted me after each viewing.In addition to the moving story, the black-and-white cinematography in here is magnificent. Not many movies today are made in black-and-white and that's too bad because with today's cameras and knowledge, it can look tremendous. (i.e. \"The Man Who Wasn't There,\" \"Ed Wood,\" etc.) The camera-work helped draw me back to several viewings.A lot of people would not watch this movie a second time and I can't blame them. It's tough to watch. There are some brutal, harrowing, scenes in here with executions, naked people being led to the gas chambers....just some very disturbing scenes. It should be seen at least once, though, by everyone.",

But I have a difficult time thinking of \"Schindler's List\" as a \"movie.\" I didn't watch it to be entertained, no person with a clear vision of the history behind it would. So for me, \"Schindler's List\" is certainly a \"film\", one about a real stain on our human history, a stain placed there solely from religious beliefs. The persecution and attempted extermination of the Jews by the German Nazis.But this \"film\", while its overall subject is the holocaust, is not really about the holocaust. While it revolves around the mistreatment of Jews by the Nazis, it is about the man, Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson. A German, a \"connected\" man in society, he went to Poland and bought a factory, employing cheap Jewish labor, hoping to get rich. He was no humanitarian. But perhaps his biggest weakness, his not being an astute businessman, was responsible for the conversion we see during the course of the three hours running time of the film. He has to rely on a Jew, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), to run his factory. And the rest, as they say, is history. He changes to the point that he risks his own life to save many, perhaps over 1000, Jews from extermination, no longer for profit but for true humanitarian motives.Unique in this time of modern movie-making, this film is mostly in Black and white. For me this works very well, because first it is such a stark subject and second, there is not so much to distract the viewer from the story. Many consider this Spielberg's best directorial effort, probably because as a Jew it was very personal to him. As a viewer, many times I found it difficult to watch, because the scenes are so realistic. I will never forget the scenes of nude prisoners being marched across the prison grounds to their deaths. I give great credit for this film's place in history, but it is not one that I enjoy watching, it is such a reminder how some can be so cruel to those who should be treated as our brothers and sisters.",

You are just drawn to the theme of this highly emotionally unforgettable masterpiece.Liam Neeson has never been better as Oskar Schindler, whose \"factory\" saved a thousand Jewish lives during the Holocaust.We see Neeson go through the film as a callous businessman to one of great feeling when he sees what is happening to the Jews of Poland.This was the first black and white film to capture the best picture Oscar since 1960's \"The Apartment.\"Neeson gets tremendous support from Ben Kingsley as his bookkeeper and an amazingly brilliant performance by Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, the Nazi mad-dog official. Fiennes portrayal is absolutely frightening as he steals each scene he is in in this remarkable film.The ending will tear at your heart as those saved place stones on Jewish graves.A positively memorable Holocaust film with memorable detail depicted. The liquidation of the ghetto scenes are a haunting memory to what happened in Nazi occupied Europe.Who can forget the little girl's colored coat as she too becomes a victim of the Nazi genocide?

I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List\". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but \"Schindler's List\" is a three hour film that feels too short.",

        "text": "Schindler's List is a film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories.It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler,Ralph Fiennes as German officer Amon Göth,and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.The film was directed by Steven Spielberg which was based on the novel, Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. In the movie,Schindler is a greedy German businessman.Then he becomes unlikely humanitarian amid his exposure of the barbaric Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story,he managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp.Steven Spielberg rose to the occasion of directing the material by making sure that people do realize the horrors that the Jews have gone through during the Holocaust.It was simply a masterpiece.The use of black and white simply with simply touches of color like the girl in dress and the light of the candle provided what powerful emotions to the viewer.Evidently,the screenplay was sharply written for the movie was authentic and sincere in its presentation.The story was simply moving and uplifting when the goodness of men were shown just as it was disturbing and horrifying when graphic violence and cruelties of men towards others were displayed. The performances of the actors/actresses were simply fantastic.Neeson was excellent as Schindler,Kingsley was fantastic as Stern and most of all,Fiennes was real and horrifying like Goethe.The cast weren't over- the-top nor were they created like movie characters,but they were treated in the film like human beings with both positive and negative traits. Finally,I could honestly say that this is one of the greatest films ever made that could rival The Godfather.This is truly a masterpiece.",

        "text": "I thought SCHINDLER`S LIST was a masterpiece when I first saw it a few years ago and having seen it again a couple of times over the years I find myself admiring it less and less after each subsequent viewing . This is down to my gut feeling that the film sugarcoats many events , especially the eponymous character . Remember the scene at the end where Oskar Schindler gives away his goldnes parteiabzeichen in order to finance the saving of some more lives ? It`s a very touching scene but in reality this badge would have no value , so how is this explained ? Very easily - The holocaust happened but that scene didn`t. And I find the character interaction somewhat cheesy between Schindler and Stern . It`s like Stern`s manipulating Schindler while Schindler is making it clear that he doesn`t need manipulating because he`s going to save as many human lives as possible . It`s like the film is trying to say only someone who is good by nature can benefit humanity , an almost insulting simplification and rose tinted view of human nature . This is why I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes performance as Amon Goeth so much . He`s a Nazi murderer who shoots woman and kids , but Fiennes plays him not as an inhuman goose stepping monster but as an all too flawed human one .",

Nor are there enough adjectives to describe the performances--especially Liam Neeson as the enigmatic Schindler, a complex man who ironically becomes a saviour of Jewish souls. Although lengthy, it never once loses tension or interest and the decision to use black and white photography was a wise one, considering that all the war footage in the '40s was seen only in monochrome. Ralph Fiennes gives a masterful performance as the chief Nazi villain and should have won a Best Actor Oscar for his work. The John Williams score has a haunting quality--his main theme is a fascinating example of his uncanny ability to connect with the material he was scoring. As powerful a film as ever emerged about World War II, this film will undoubtedly increase in reputation as the years pass, fully deserving of all the praise it reaps.

        "text": "\"Schindler's List\" is a powerful movie that is a reminder to the world of where hatred can lead to. The movie shows the Holocaust in the most powerful and confronting way possible. It doesn't hold back with its images or story. In that regard \"Schindler's List\" is a daring movie but the end result is more powerful than you could have ever imagined. The movie tells the true story of Nazi-party member Oskar Schindler, who as the war progresses sees more and more horrors of the Holacaust and decides to help the Jews in the best way possible for him.\"Schindler's List\" is honestly one of the movie powerful movies ever created. Since almost everything in the movie is based on true events it makes it all even more powerful. It's hard to imaging that these horrible things all actually truly occurred. The movie is filled with graphic, confronting and humiliating images. It provides the movie with some unforgettable sequences that will leave a lasting impression on you. Never has the Holocaust been brought to the silver screen in such a detailed and confronting way. Not everyone will be able to handle watching \"Schindler's List\". It really is not a movie for the faint of heart.Spielberg delivers with this movie his most important and perhaps also most personal and best movie. The storytelling of the movie is perfect and the way it focuses on the many characters of the movie is spot-on. It follows many different Jewish characters who all had their different experiences.Yes, the movie does become over-sentimental at times, especially toward the ending but in this case I forgive Spielberg. It in no way makes the movie any less powerful or meaningful. The message of the movie comes trough very hard and direct. Everyone should watch this movie, not only because it's such a good one but especially because it's a very important one.The movie is filmed in black & white. I think main reason for this was to make the movie look less graphic, since the main essence of the movie should not be on the graphic images but on the confronting and realistic emotions of history. It's not a movie that tries to shock, it's a movie that confronts in a very direct way instead. Whatever the real true reason was for making the movie in black & white, it works really well for the movie its time period and atmosphere. The lighting of director of photography Janusz Kaminski is really phenomenal at times. Also the dramatic musical score by John Williams is impressive and makes some of the sequences work even extra powerful.Also the acting is great in this movie. The Jewish persons are mostly played by unknown and unexperienced actors. It makes them. in their roles, extra credible and believable. We see them as persons, not as actors playing persons. That's also another reason why the movie works powerful, the characters are all very real. Not only the Jews but also the Nazi-Germans. The movie launched the careers of both Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. Liam Neeson is great as the main lead and Ralph Fiennes is truly chilling as the camp commander Amon Goeth. Another fine impressive role is being played by Ben Kingsley.Among the best movies of the 20th century but more important, it's a very important movie that reminds us of what happened- and should never happen again.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

        "text": "Schindler's List is undeniably one of the most emotionally moving films ever made, not only for the Jewish people, but for humanity. The perfectly accurate depiction of the persecution and execution of Jews is indeed heartbreaking and moving. The portrayal of Schindler, who transforms from being a cold, egotistical, greedy bastard, who only cared about making money, profit, into a selfless, giving person who worked very hard, and gave everything to save as many people as he possibly could. The film also perfectly and chillingly depicts how the Nazi's threw the Jews around, shoving them around, shooting them if they felt like it, for no reason. The film has a great cinematography, that really captures the intensity of the situations and scenes. The plot is good, and moves along at a good pace, though it will test your patience if you aren't interested in the subject of the film (though I don't really see why anyone wouldn't be, at the very least, interested). The acting is all great, by every single actor, but the one I really noticed was Liam Neeson, who portrays Oskar Schindler, a character who undergoes a major development through the film. The script is good, as it allows the audience to see an accurate depiction of just about every single situation that Jews were in, during the war. It is a depressing film, yes, and a sad one, since it tells a very disturbing story, but it should be seen by just about anyone who can sit through it(it does have some violent scenes, but nothing very graphic), as it is a very important and beautiful movie. Any person who considers him or herself to be literate and intelligent should see this movie at least once. You don't get a more accurate portrayal of the horror of being a Jew during that time than this. I recommend this movie to anyone who can sit through it, both concerning the length and the violence in it. 10/10",

It felt like the movie Steven Spielberg had been waiting years to make, and despite his previous efforts at making movies for grown ups (\"The Color Purple\"), this is the first movie that suggested he was maturing as a film maker.So does it hold up after all these years? Mostly. But is it a typical Spielberg movie? Most definitely. The first 3/4 of the film are compulsively watchable and entertaining, if you can consider brutal and graphic scenes of concentration camp violence entertaining. Spielberg uses a near-documentary style that fits the material perfectly, and using black and white with only occasional splashes of color feels like an inspired decision. But boy is that last quarter of the film schmaltzy, and has Spielberg's gooey fingerprints all over it. I don't know that something as horrific as the Holocaust needs a lot of emotional embellishment, but Spielberg just can't help himself.However, I forgive Spielberg in this particular case. This was obviously a story that meant a great deal to him, and I'm not sure it's fair to expect him to remain emotionally distant from it. He tells his story with a great deal of passion, and for the most part he tells it very well.Grade: A",

It isn't his first (or his last) serious movie, but it is his best and, notwithstanding the enormous impact his entire output has had on the movie industry, I would go so far as to say it is the film he was born to make.Spielberg does the impossible, in a number of ways. He takes one of the most appalling periods of how vile man can be to his fellow man and, without losing any of the emotional and visceral impact of that inhumanity, wrings something inspirational and human out of it - we watch fascinated, moved, devastated, and - if we are even halfway human ourselves - improved by the experience of watching the story unfold.This film is brilliant in so many ways, not least of which is the fact that the protagonists - Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern - are no one-dimensional caricatures, created for the single purpose of delivering plot developments. No, they - and all the characters in this wonderful, harrowing film - are real people, neither all good nor all bad.Watch it to see a truly gifted director exercising his art at the very top of his game, not that Spielberg has ever been anywhere else.",

Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives.Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid.The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever.

This movie is source of a special experience. And the causes are numerous:1) It is an artistic masterpiece. Light, images, acting, script and silence, nuances of tragedy and delicate suggestions are pieces of a fascinating approach. So, it is result of a deep and powerful sentiment and Spielberg is the gorgeous sculptor of its.2} The story is old and aching. The Shoah is not a Jewish or German problem or result of propaganda. The good and the evil are elements, in that crime, not of ethics or faith, education or fear, mercy or public image but seal of atrocious ambiguity. And this vagueness is fundamental part of our world. In fact,it is essence of its conscience. So, the irrational brutality of Goeth is only cliché. The bad Nazi, cruel, sarcastic and bizarre is rotten puppet of a death period. After \"The Night of the Generals\" this character type is absurd.3} Fundamental value of film is the subtle art of suggest a reality out of any description's form. Images are poor shadow of a crime without limit or reason. And this suggestion is represented by Neeson's acting; the metamorphose of an ordinary business man in a hero part of his mission.4} The interpretation of Sir Ben Kingsley is touching.

        "text": "For a movie as monumental as Schindler's List, I believe a review should be conducted in a different style. Normally, my reviews consist of multiple paragraphs, summarizing the plot and my thoughts on the film. This time I want to give five reasons why Schindler's List was easily one of the most powerful and breathtaking motion pictures I've ever seen. It goes above and beyond anyone's expectation, and cements itself on the list of greatest films of all time. Here's why.1. Acting. No one could write about Schindler's List and not talk about Liam Neeson's Oscar worthy performance as Oskar Schindler, the business man from Czechoslovakia. He plays it with power and full force, grade A acting. Still shocked his leading performance didn't win him the Oscar in 1994.2. Storyline. Instead of focusing on one of the survivors, or a fictional story for that matter, Spielberg chooses to focus on Oskar Schindler, a rather unsung chapter and character of The Holocaust. Oskar Schindler worked for the Nazis, and is famous for using his great wealth to buy hundreds of Jews to make them work in his factory. It wasn't much, but it prevented death, and they would make bowls for the Nazis. Even though the film goes into a subject, some may not know, the storyline is definitely one of the strongest points.3. The end sequence. I don't want to ruin the final scenes in the film, but let's just say, it's one of the most effective and well done scenes in film history.4. The film's desire to \"show it all.\" When Holocaust movies are made, so try to water the film down by not showing the terrible treatment of innocent Jews. This one doesn't. Despite the event being gruesome, tasteless, and ignorant, no movie should subject itself to water down the scenes. Unless it's PG-13, and I doubt many Holocaust movies are. Schindler's List isn't all about the gas chambers and things most of us already know. We witness two of the worst things possible; (1) innocent people taken out to the yard and being shot in the head with absolutely no feeling on the guard's part and (2) we see the heart-wrenching scenes of peoples belonging getting tossed off balconies like garbage. That part I almost couldn't bear to watch.5. The complete carelessness for human life. Face it, the Jews and many other races were dehumanized come time of The Holocaust. Life didn't matter to anybody. You could tell a Nazi officer that you just killed sixty thousand Jews in one day and they wouldn't flinch, yell, smile, or object. They would say \"Good work.\" They wouldn't take into consideration you just killed sixty thousand mothers, father, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and worst of all, children of both sexes. One scene in the film, right before a woman is shot in the head, the camera zooms in on her to show her frightened reactions, her pale face, and her clearly nervous behavior. Spielberg most likely did that to remind viewers that the victims in this movie were people and they were innocent people with their own feelings in life. Dehumanization lived in The Holocaust.Schindler's List currently ranks number nine on the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of one hundred greatest American films ever made. I am a firm believer that if this wasn't in Spielberg's hands, it wouldn't touch that list. Thankfully, we get one down to Earth and very vibrant Holocaust movies that manages to accomplish what it should. Just an all around amazing film.Starring: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagall, and Embeth Davidtz. Directed by: Steven Spielberg.",

Or laughing at parts when the natzi soldiers would point their guns at the jews and they lifted their hands surrendering. What was so funny? I was in shock on my generation's view of this disaster.Schinler's List is a classic movie. But I can't watch it.

        "text": "At the time of this film's release, while he was the undisputed commercial king of cinema, Steven Spielberg had never been considered a 'serious' film-maker. With the exception of The Colour Purple he was known as a director of big-budget B-pictures. Many people criticized his films for being too syrupy and child-like. With the notable exceptions of Duel and Jaws this wasn't necessarily an unfair assessment. While his vision was unerringly on the pulse of the mainstream, it rarely had any edge whatsoever. So with the release of Schindler's List, Spielberg was able to offer something pretty bleak and hard-hitting. He was also rewarded at the Academy Awards, which was another thing he craved desperately.The book by Thomas Keneally from which the film was adapted is a masterful and deeply disturbing account of true events in Nazi occupied Poland. It takes a documentary approach to events, as it is all from real accounts. It was, therefore, the sort of novel that had to be treated with the utmost respect if it was to be translated to the screen with any success. It has to be said that Spielberg was largely very successful in this challenge, and his film remains a powerful telling of this most harrowing, if ultimately uplifting, of tales. He wisely decided to film it in stark black and white which lends an immediate bleakness to proceedings and recalls old footage from the Second World War. When he does decide to inject a bit of colour, as in the little girl in the red coat, it works in bringing out the appalling tragedy of this little girl's life even more – it doesn't seem gimmicky. Another major plus for the film is in the performances. Liam Neeson has the right blend of charisma and humanity as Oskar Schindler but best of all is Ralph Fiennes as the camp commandant Amon Goeth; he played this character with extreme skill and brought to the screen a strangely complex presence. I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say Fiennes's Goeth was sympathetic – he was vile – but his underlying impulses and insecurities had interesting depth to say the least.On the whole Spielberg handles things very well here. His trademark schmaltz is thankfully absent, and he does not hold back when he needs to ramp things up and show atrocities. Quite often Schindler's List is very unpleasant, and the director wisely doesn't sugar-coat things. The only place where he breaks is in Schindler's closing speech at the factory. This moment was melodramatic and totally unnecessary. The events depicted up to that point had been faithfully told from a historical point-of-view and they did not need that invented moment of emotional manipulation; what had gone before spoke for itself. This minor slip-up aside, Schindler's List did prove that Spielberg was capable to making serious films when he put his mind to it.",

        "text": "This movie is difficult to watch as it, in detail, expresses the sheer horror and grisliness of the Holocaust. From the forced relocation of the Jews toward the ghettos to the terrors of Auschwitz, the persecution of the Jews is a centerpiece of this film and it will resonate in your mind long after this movie is over. This movie also centers around the life of Oskar Schindler, played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, as a money-hungry German businessman who employs Jews to work in his factory, but ultimately grows concerned for the well-being of the Jews as he witnesses their merciless persecution by the Nazis. His mission in turning his factory into a salvation for the Jews throughout WWII becomes a driving force for the plot and builds up the suspense and tension, making you eager to find out what the aftermath is by the film's end.Ben Kingsley gave a great performance of Itzhak Stern, the Jew who ends up being Schindler's trusted assistant and right-hand man, and Ralph Fiennes gave a haunting portrayal of the evil and sadistic Amon Goeth - an ultimate villain you would love to hate. And, all the supporting actors and extras who portrayed the Jews gave a heartfelt performance; even as actors, you really sympathize with them as they gave such a realistic and heart wrenching portrayal.Janusz Kaminski did a good job on the cinematography, capturing the aura and tension of World War II; John Williams gave a stirring music score with a beautiful violin solo by Izak Perlman; and Steven Spielberg did a nice job directing a well-paced film.It's true that some people criticizes the accuracy and historical facts of the film and the overly intensiveness of the plot elements, but, it is no doubt an impactful film about the Holocaust and the courageous deeds of a man who sought to save many.Grade B+",

        "text": "This movie must be the best piece of work dealing with the Holocaust that I have ever seen. The only criticism I can find myself making of it is that it was a little bit confusing in the first hour or so, but even that was probably appropriate as the movie portrays a time of chaos anyway. The first thing that one notices is the decision to film the movie in black and white. That was a brilliant decision. Somehow, it gives the story greater power. The brutality of the Holocaust is obvious, the sadistic nature of the SS is portrayed brilliantly, both in depictions of actual events and by Ralph Fiennes in his portrayal of SS officer Amon Goeth, the confusion and uncertainty and desperation of the Jews is palpable. Everything is raw with power. I would have liked some greater explanation of the impact of the little girl who provides the only splashes of colour in the movie (she's dressed in red) on Schindler. She's hardly the only child he sees suffer. Why her in particular?Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Itzhak Stern, the Jewish accountant recruited by Schindler to run his business is appropriately low-key. Here was a man who saw an opportunity to help his fellow Jews through Schindler's company and who quietly took advantage of it. Which brings me to Liam Neeson's portrayal of Schindler. He did a great job - completely believable as he portrays Schindler's evolution from a businessman who just wanted to make money and who brought Jews into his factory for no reason except that they were the cheapest labour available to a man determined to protect his Jewish workers from the insanity and horror of Auschwitz. The closing scene, as he breaks down crying out that he feels he should have saved more people, is one of the most powerful and moving scenes I have ever seen in a movie, especially as Stern quietly comforts him and says \"no - you did so much\" and the other Jews he saved rush up to embrace and comfort him. It was also moving to see the Schindler Jews honouring his grave at the end of the movie. Schindler provides the inspiration here. Yes, it's inspiring that he saved 1200 Jews, but the inspiration goes beyond that. As the story makes clear, Schindler was largely a failure at everything he did in life, both before and after the war. And yet, this man - who was (I hate to use the word, but it's pretty much true) a loser - managed to rise to what must have seemed an insurmountable challenge and accomplished something great of historic proportions. If a man like Schindler could do this, surely others can do it too - not with respect to the Holocaust anymore (thank God!) but with some of the other issues in the world today. This is truly a brilliant piece of work. 9/10",

        "text": "INTRODUCTION :Steven Spielberg always developed an interest for WW2 more than any other film-maker of his generation, mostly concerned by the Vietnam War and its cultural impact. Therefore, he revolutionized the Industry of film-making, not the mentalities. He never made thought-provoking or introspective films like \"Apocalypse Now\" or \"Taxi Driver\".This attachment to the past, to childhood cemented Spielberg's indisputable talent to entertain and touch hearts, genuinely or deliberately. Spielberg had a traditional view on film-making, which consecrated him when the 80's saw the return of a more conventional style. In the early 90's, he was the most successful director capable of the best like \"Duel\", \"Jaws\" or \"The Color Purple\", movies where, ironically, his touch was less present, as much as the worst like \"Hook\" which caricatured the Spielberg traits to the extreme.When Spielberg dilutes himself behind the camera, he can be incredible, when he indulged himself to express some sentimentality; it rarely worked after the 80's. That's why my favorite of his films, \"The Color Purple\" is the most misunderstood, why \"Jurassic Park\" will never surpass \"Jaws\" and why \"Saving Private Ryan\" is weak compared to the movie I'll review now : \"Schindler's List\".SCHINDLER'S LIST :The movie opens on a religious ceremony, the colors slowly fade, like a painful flash-back into an episode forever rooted in memories. And the black-and-white cinematography suggests the haunting presence of death in the minds of people whose only \"crime\" was to be Jewish and the hearts of us, viewers, whose only \"excuse\" was to be born after that tragedy. And there starts a tragedy of epic proportions following different levels of grief.DENIAL OF EVILNESS : When a one-armed old man is killed like an animal because he's useless for the Third Reich, I was caught by surprise. When kids were shot, I was shocked. And I have no words to describe the whole Krakovia Ghetto massacre sequence. The duality of horror as the most atrocious form of barbarity that contaminated civilized men ; how can a man who plays Bach or Mozart, exterminate a family with the same hand? Or a beautiful gift allowing sick people 'to never hear the gunshots'.ANGRY INCOMPREHENSION : One of the most despicable movie characters ever, Amon Goeth, whose leisure consisted on killing Jews in the most gratuitous way, doesn't even deserve to be called 'villain' as his evilness transcends any cinematic perception. The shooting of the engineer Diana Reiter is the part I couldn't get out of my mind, so unexpected, random and cold-blooded, the moment defines the torture endured by people in Concentration Camps, not just physical, but psychological, as any day could be the last one of your whole life, depending on the mood of an officer, or a defect in a gun.DEATH ACCEPTANCE : The absurd level of cruelty changes the very perception of death, and provides sometimes some sort of darkly comedic reliefs moments, like when a kid points his finger on the chicken thief who's 'coincidentally' the first man shot by Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes as the suave beast, who exercised his right to kill or spare like a Roman Emperor, perfectly captured the essence of evilness trapped in his own torments, probably loving his power more than hating the Jews, as the exaltation of a kind of bestial superiority.DEVASTATING SADNESS : The word 'depression' would be an indecent understatement, some passages are absolutely devastating, thanks to a direction, guilty of perfection, and John Williams' sober and emotional score. I understand this must have been painful for Spielberg, a man who loves children, to shoot the part where kids hid in a toilet hole, where the little girl in red 'reappeared', not to mention the gut-wrenching climactic shower scene. My heart was hysterically screaming with these women who thought it was the end.LIGHT OF HOPE : Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler as a man with a way with people and women in particular. However, his depiction is undermined by something betraying the ambitious nature of a War profiteer. This characterization proved to work for characters like Rick Blaine (there's something strangely Bogart-esque in the way Neeson holds his cigarette) but the subject here is too serious for glamorization. He's a businessman who thinks of interests, and progressively, his natural charisma will become providential. It's ironic how he, the German, and his Jewish assistant, Yitzhac Stern, played by Ben Kingsley, handle as a business project what will be one of the most generous and humanistic acts ever. Who saves one life, saves the humanity  CONCLUSION :Whatever I said in this review concerning Spielberg loses its relevance when it comes to \"Schindler's list\", his greatest film because it's probably the only one where you can find both the personal touch, and something that speaks for Humanity, to remember one of its most shameful pages.But the criticism starts again regarding the reception of \"Schindler's List\". The film has been described with so many superlatives that I really question the sincerity of this immediate prestige and if it's not just proportional with the gravity of the subject. Does \"Schindler's List\" really deserve to be in the American Film Institute's Top 10? Is it really that iconic in American Pop Culture? I also read that \"Schindler's List\" was voted the best film ever made by the German film magazine 'Cinema', and it felt like the film was automatically praised as a way to make up for the guilt of having allowed these crimes to be committed. I hope I am wrong because I truly love \"Schindler's List\", but I just don't like the simplistic and systematical way the movie is praised.But I sincerely hope the inspirational message of the film would inspire others about so many overlooked atrocities, just because some countries can't generate a film-maker with the same talent and influence as Steven Spielberg.",

        "text": "STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs The true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a German businessman during World War 2 who saved the lives of around 1100 Jews by creating a use for them as labourers in his factories before moving them to his hometown as a safe refuge from Auswhictz in the closing days of World War 2.I'm not sure quite what Spielberg was trying to accomplish by filming this project in black and white,but if he was trying to add a darker,more authentic tone than the film already had,he has failed.There was colour back in those dark times of the Holocaust,and it would have had a more real edge had it been included (with the exception of a little girl running through a crowd in one scene in a red jacket looking like she'd popped right out of a Butlins advert!)What he's succeeded more in doing is paying homage to those b/w war movies from the late 50s/early 60s,and perhaps added a nice touch of film noir for good measure.As a kid (when I originally saw this film) a film running at nearly three and a quarter hours would have seemed like an eternity,but I must say watching it again today the length did seem to run by comparatively quickly.The film does seem to suffer from a lack of narrative flow,although the actual story remains no less engaging.It is certainly a harrowing account of surely one of the most evil events in human history.We see Jews being treated with less dignity and respect than dogs,and the Nazis certainly put less value on their lives than them.Neeson delivers a commanding central performance as the wartime businessman propelled by his own needs and desires,but offered salvation through his care and concern for the plight of the Jewish people.There's good support,too,from Ralph Fiennes (who would go on to accomplish even bigger and greater things-not including The Avengers!) as the heartless,sadistic Nazi soldier and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's wearisome accountant.Overall,this film doesn't manage to be quite as shocking as it was trying to be by being filmed in black and white (which not everything in life is,anyway!).Senior Spielbergo would go on direct another powerful war film some years later by the name of Saving Private Ryan,which had an unforgettably powerful opening sequence involving the Normandy landings which was filmed in colour and managed to stick in the memory much more prolificly.However,it is gut-wrenching stuff nonetheless and certainly not a film that deserves to be forgotten in a hurry.*****",

        "text": "I had no expectations going into this movie.  I had heard different opinions about it and I was pleasantly blown away by it.  It left me in tears which few movies ever truly do.  I honestly believe this to be one of the top ten greatest films of all time...not necessarily because of it's watchability but because of it's content and the way it is filmed. Liam Neeson (Who I have never been fond of) plays Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who is a brilliant business man, con artist, and German personality.  He loves his ladies and his booze but is also quite humane right from the very beginning.  When the Germans invade Poland and begin to send Jews into Ghetto's he opens a factory making cookware (pots and pans) using the jews as labor.  However, it isn't cruel labor but rather he is giving them a purpose and treats them as equal workers giving them benefits and good working conditions...to him...he's just making his money.  He is very humble about everything and does not see why the Jews are so happy with him.  As the movie continues we see the honest progression of the war and the hatred towards the Jews.  The rumours of the gas chamber begin to circulate, and we watch as Almon Goeth played chillingly by Ralph Fiennes (another actor I have never been overly fond of) murders Jews at will keeping the other Jews in check by fear.  Goeth is a power hungry, Nazi who thrives on seeing people suffer by his hand.  He's been given a high powered rank and milks it for all it's worth and enjoys it.  He snipers Jews from his window...just for sport.  He's empty and pure evil.  When Schindler happens to oversee a Ghetto raid by the SS he is moved to tears as he watches his workers being brutalized.  As he makes his millions he wields his own more subtle power with bribes, women, food, wine, reputation in order to progress his business and save his workers. He then takes a quite signifigant more direct role by actually buying off top ranking Nazi officials in order to \"buy\" Jewish workers...the workers and their families who worked for him in his cookware plant.  He begins to make a list of 1100 Jewish people he wants bought and brought by train to his new Munitions plant where they are to make shell casings for bombs.  A very intense scene takes place when the Jewish women he \"purchased\" are re-routed to the wrong place because of an error in paper work.  They think that this is it for them and the gas chamber will be their destination but the error is fixed and the women arrive unharmed to Schindler's Plant.  In the most moving scene in movie history...Schindler breaks down before escaping Allied forces at the end of the war and realizes how many had died outside his factory and how many he wished he could have saved.  Liam Neeson performance in this entire movie but especially in that scene will haunt me forever.  This film is never to be tossed on a back shelf...it is so much more than a classic...it's brilliance.  I don't, however, necessarily take it as historical fact when it comes to Schindler. In reading on him I don't see him quite as the beloved character you feel in the movie.  He seemed more selfish and perhaps less humble in real life...but nonetheless the man saved 1100 and then some Jews and that to me makes him a hero no matter what.  This movie though is one no one can ever miss.  It's a triumph!!! 10/10",

But since this is a universally acclaimed Oscar-winner, I decided to see it.This is a very realistic film. It deplicits the horror that Polish Jews went through, and I have never seen a film with such power. The film, I was glad, did not start off suddenly with the Jews, and throughout the film, we are able to look into characters' emotions and minds. A lot of character are seen in this film, and they are given development, so we can actually care about them. There were a lot of actors involved in this film, and the main actors, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, all do great jobs. They each make their characters unique. They each give their whole into it.The film has a lot to deal with. It really is a 'grand' film. The productions and the cost of all the actors and stunts must have been hard. In those scenes, scenes that we are able to see how disturbing Jews lived, those scenes are amazing. There are a lot of powerful ones, and we can surely distinguish them. The cinematography is simply amazing. Some of the best I have ever seen, the use of the camera, and the pacing etc. This is a very technical achievement as well. It really did look like we were witnessing real persons being tortured.Overall, this is simply a masterpiece. Yes, I thought it was a bit long. I actually felt a little restless in parts, and sort of dull, but I still recognized the achievement, and although I couldn't really follow in all the dialogue, I still appreciated it. That is what a masterpiece is. A work or art, a work of realism to give the audience. Everyone should see this film. You cannot help but feel a little distraught for all these people. The ending scene, with the actors walking with their real-life character portrayals, was simply emotional. It really gets to you. It is simply Steven Spielberg's greatest work he ever made.",

The production values are extremely high, the cinematography (shot almost completely in black and white) is a sight to behold, the original score is amazing, the screenplay is complicated and unrelenting, and the performances are some of the best ever from any film ever produced.  However, it is Spielberg's direction that makes \"Schindler's List\" the instant classic that it is.  The film deals with a businessman (Liam Neeson in an Oscar-nominated role) who looks to profit from World War II by producing war goods for the Nazi Army and employing ghetto Jews as cheap labor.  Ben Kingsley plays a Jewish accountant who acts as Schindler's right-hand man who makes sure that he gets as many Jews as he can to save them from imminent deaths at Nazi war camps.  When Schindler witnesses what is really going on he has a change of heart and starts to save the Jews of Poland by buying them from a sadistic Nazi commander (Ralph Fiennes in an Oscar-nominated role).  Needless to say, Schindler develops the \"list\" with Kingsley and over 1,000 Jews were saved from certain deaths at the hands of the Nazi army.  \"Schindler's List\" is one of those utterly brilliant films that are rarely made today, or at any time for that matter.  This is also one of the most important films ever made.  When this film was initially released in 1993 some doubted the Holocaust had ever actually happened.  Many professors from prominent universities were convincing young people that the Holocaust was a fictional tool of propaganda used by the Allied Powers to create support for their cause.  Of course this is ridiculous, but many people were believing this trite.  That is the primary reason why this film is such an amazing success. Spielberg had an urge to do this project way back in the early-1980s, but did not feel he was quite ready for the harsh material (he was probably right in waiting).  He offered the project to Martin Scorsese (who also did not feel comfortable with the material) and even Stanley Kubrick (he was not interested).  Billy Wilder, well in his 80s at the time, also showed considerable interest.  However, Spielberg bought his time and went forward when he finally felt the time was right.  The timing was perfect and this film is perfect.  Easily one of the top 10 films of all time.  5 stars out of 5.",

I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

        "text": "Finally, the last movie in the series. Finally, Peter Jackson makes his intentions clear. Now we realise that the first two movies in this series were just the build up to this epic of a film. A masterful masterpiece, a flawless work of cinema whose only fault is that it seems too short. I don't have much to say about this; I don't want to spoil anything. But this is the big one. It completely blows the other two great movies out of the water. Suddenly, everything is more adult, more dramatic, and ten times the emotion. You could call it an emotional roller-coaster ride; certainly Jackson touches the nerves and heart-strings on more than one occasion.The centrepiece of the film is the battle for Minas Tirith, a huge war scene which features amazing special effects unlike anything ever seen before. An army of 300,000 riders on the heroes who defend their city with courage and spirit. Dragons fly down from the sky, huge boulders are tossed back and forth, and an army of trolls and oliphants are sent in to obliterate the heroes. Everything is dark and gruesome; Jackson reveals his origins by including many graphic and gruesome deaths which somehow make the 12A certificate a bit of a joke. Men are decapitated, crushed, impaled, and burnt. Heads fly over city walls and the viewer just sits and gapes at the magnificence of it all.The casting is excellent. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen come into their own. Billy Boyd is given serious stuff to deal with now, not just comic relief: his singing over the death of the soldiers is extremely moving and a stand against all generals who sit back and send their men to certain death. Miranda Otto comes into her own. The new character of Denethor is great, just as in the book. Legolas and Gimli are still there, although on the sidelines as always. But the real emotion comes from Elijah Wood and Sean Astin: this pair are brilliant, and their final journey to Mount Doom will bring tears to anybody's eyes through the heartache involved. Gollum is a force to be reckoned with this time and cannot be forgotten.After the slow build-up of the initial hour, things explode in cinematic heaven. The battles are amazing, topped by the arrival of the ghost army, sheer brilliance. Shelob is a wonderful special effect and extremely frightening. There is so much to love and thankfully the powerhouse ending doesn't disappoint. The only problem with this film is that it properly ends about 30 minutes before the credits, and Jackson fills the final 30 minutes with endless mawkish sentimentality which becomes truly sickening. Sadly, it doesn't spoil what's come before; I just tune out at this part.",

Pippin touches the crystal ball and Sauron mistakenly assumes that he is the ring bearer. Gandalf and Pippin travel to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith but they find mad Denethor on the throne.The quest comes to an end. There is a ton of CGI and it's state of the art. It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven. Technically it is far superior and the story is a compelling epic.",

I have not studied \"The Lord of the Rings\" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of.",

        "text": "\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\", which sounds like a Robin Hood reference, is the final chapter to Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\"-series. It stars most of the cast from the two previous films and also the crew does not look that much different. What does look different is the awards output. While the first was really successful with the Academy and the second moderately, this one won 11 Oscars, all categories where it was nominated, but missed out on one category to be the alone record holder. This was maybe the cinematography category, where it wasn't even nominated surprisingly. Still, the Best Picture win and Director for Jackson should make up for it.The film features lots of Gollum again too. Actually, it starts with Smeagol back when he was a human. Not much later, we see the killing of Saruman, something we may have expected to be one of the final moments, but this happens so that we see Sauron as the true antagonist of this film and the whole franchise. I found it a bit surprising as Saruman was definitely the main villain in the first two films, the first more than the second. Another thing I liked was the water reflection scene with Gollum/Smeagol. Nicely done here how his good side talks to his evil side. The film's central point is Minas Tirith, but I wasn't too thrilled by that. Scenes like Pippin's possible death with that fireball that he could not put away were more interesting and spectacular than the fight sequences. The part about Boromir's father and the fight for paternal love maybe helped the movie with its award ambitions as the topic is still relevant today, even if in a different manner.Other than that, the arguing between Sam and Gollum continues from the second movie. I just wonder why Sam would lay down so close to the abyss with Gollum around. Anyway, the scene where Frodo sends Sam away is one of the emotional highlights from the trilogy. Pretty sad. In addition to that, Frodo (before he meets the spider) screams Smeagol a couple times, then whispers Sam and realizes who his real friend is. The spider scene is really one of the most intense from all three movies. What a disgusting creature and a perfect moment to pick as it proves Gollum has been evil all the time and even a main antagonist to the two courageous Hobbits at the end. Later on, Sam appears to free Frodo from the Orc headquarter and I wondered a bit why Sam showed the ring to Frodo first. I'd have thought just get out of there guys and not stay there a second longer than you have to.In addition, a couple fathers are dying, good ones and bad ones, and the storyline with Miranda Otto's character is continued. I never found that particularly interesting though and the final chapter doesn't change that. I actually could have done without it in its entirety. Then also the film would not have dragged on some occasions.Finally we get a firework of lava as closure and a sequence which seemed more like a dream (where I thought something bad was about to happen), but it was real, including a final beautiful moment between Sam and Frodo. Astin was the MVP from the final film for me, maybe even the trilogy. If McKellen got an Oscar nomination for the Fellowship, Astin at least would have deserved one too here. Sadly he did not get any, but it was refreshing to see how he stole the films from all these established Hollywood actors being almost a no-name when the trilogy started.It would also have been a nice ending if the film had ended when they all bowed down to the four Hobbits, but it went on for a bit afterward. We find out that the journey started 13 months ago and what happened to Bilbo in the meantime, pretty sad actually. The ending looked almost as if there would be a Sam sequel, but actually we got a Bilbo prequel in these last three years. Annie Lennox' song with the closing credits also won an Oscar for the Eurythmics singer (Enya was nominated two movies earlier) and while I thought it was okay, I believe she has done some better work in her career.All in all, I recommend watching this film/trilogy. I would not call it epic as many do, but it can provide for some nice entertainment and over eleven fantastic hours of film if you are into fantasy movies.",

        "text": "Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum.  Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film.  For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent.  Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well.  I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes.  There is a clear scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes - which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end.  To Joe Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high (with the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole trilogy!)  This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do understand why it was done this way.The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent.  Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship.  Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension).  Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role.  I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things.  Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy.  His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny.  Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish.  He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way.  It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment.  Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game.  Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was!  This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film.  Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film.  It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it is an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me.",

        "text": "Like with the first two LotR movies, I hadn't (and still haven't I have to admit) read the books. So if your're looking for any comparison between the book and the movie, you have to look for other comments (and there are plenty of them here). The only thing I know, is that a small part of the end of book two (Two Towers) is implemented in Return of the King. Unfortunately for me, a review I read about the movie, did spoil that fact for me.In case you aren't aware of the book, I won't spoil anything that happens in this movie. But I'm going to assume that you have watched the previous installments (\"Two Towers\" and \"Fellowship\"). Our group has split up in 3 different smaller groups, each of which has it's own journey to go through. While Frodo and Sam have found themselves a companion in Gollum, the end of part two has hinted something dark that might happen here.That's one of the best things of the movies: The interaction and sometimes even seamless transitions between characters feelings for each other (Legolas vs. Gimli to name but one). Most of the time it's done in a subtle manner and even if it's played theatrically (here in this movie, a relationship between a father and his sons), it's impossible to defy the magic this movie brings onto your screen.The action is great (although a villain we can hang ourselves onto, like the leader of the Uruk-Hai in the first movie, is still missing) and the landscape phenomenal as in every movie of the series. While it was clear, that the actors wouldn't be considered Oscar material, they all bring their A-game and especially Viggo Mortensen is a revelation (makes you still wonder, what would've happened if the original actor that was cast for that role, went through with it).The main problem I see here (and many others have stated that also), lies at the end ... well \"endings\". The movie doesn't seem to know, when to stop. So while you think all is over, you get another set-piece ... and another one ... and another one. While this might seem like nit-picking to some, some others were bothered very much by that fact. Still this is the best Fantasy Franchise that has hit our screens and makes other efforts seem pretty dull (Dungeons & Dragons anyone?). Now let's see if I can manage to read \"The Hobbit\" before they make a movie out of it ... (I've already read a few pages)",

        "text": "Weary beyond words, Hobbit companions Frodo and Sam continue their journey to destroy the One Ring, with the sinister Gollum still their guide. The film opens interestingly with Gollum's origin story, capturing his descent into depravity and madness, finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. The ring has the power to affect it's bearer, and not for good.With the battle of Helm's Deep over and Saruman's power gone, the attention focuses on the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. There the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy, while those visible are more of a threat than ever. \"The Return of the King\" in it's way is as much Aragorn's story as it is Frodo's; a reluctant noble struggling to find his destiny who comes to accept and eventually embrace it under the tutelage of the White Wizard Gandalf. The subtle subtext of Aragorn's relationship with Lady Arwen of the Elven realm leads to his triumph with no illusions for Eowyn, establishing a noble grace and dignity for the new King.Upon my second viewing of the entire trilogy, I was surprised at how my attention was continually drawn to the character of Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's faithful companion. This in large part to the excellent portrayal by Sean Astin, showing a range of emotions throughout the film that proffered him as the most well developed character of the story. He's a loyal friend through thick and thin, understanding clearly that by the journey's near end, Frodo's mind may no longer be his own.Gimli is another character to keep a close eye on for the understated humor John Rhys-Davies brings to the story. The personal competition he began with Legolas (Orlando Bloom) in \"The Two Towers\" finds comic resonance here; as Legolas brings down a rampaging olyphant on the Pelennor Fields, Gimli tempers his congratulations with \"That still only counts as one\" - marvelous! With the One Ring destroyed, so is Sauron's awesome power, and a quest resolved for the fortunes of mankind. The film's multiple endings encapsulate just as many feelings in the viewer, those of loyalty, honor, love, sacrifice and friendship. As a unit, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy stand as probably the ultimate in cinematic adventure to this point in time. Truly, I can only make one suggestion to make the series even more poignant, that for a film that reveals the discovery of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins, the basis for the adventure that begins in \"The Hobbit\".",

Perhaps that is one reason I was so disappointed in this movie; it wasn't nearly as interesting as the first two. The main reason can be summed up in one word: OVERKILL.Director Peter Jackson made the same mistake he made in the film he did right after this one: \"King Kong,\" where the action was way too much, too the point of ludicrousness and an insult to viewers' intelligence. So was this film, the third in the LOTR series. It was too much action, so much that after halfway through this 3 hour, 20-minute movie I was numb by then and could care less what happened from that point. I stuck with it, but it just got worse and worse with more ridiculous action scenes going on one after the other with absolutely no credibility to any of them.Examples of what I mean regarding \"credibility\" are scenes in which humongous monsters and machines 100 times the size and strength of the \"good guys\" would always lose. Even females and little Hobbitts disposed of these-supposedly indestructible creatures, time after time. It was so Rambo-like, so stupidly juvenile it was insulting to watch.After awhile, it wasn't even entertaining....the worst sin of them all for fantasy-adventure movie. To use another descriptive word, this film - like Jackson's subsequent King Kong - was EXCESSIVE.By overdoing the action, the awesome-looking creatures and the wonderful special-effects that captured the LOTR audiences for the first two movies, ended this trilogy on a sour note. Too much violence translates into \"boring.\"I also got tired of seeing a 99-percent dead \"Frodo\" somehow still managing to go on and on with these never-ending agonizing looks on his face and his little tearful buddies crying their eyes out constantly. Enough already! Finish the story!This was overkill of the worst magnitude and an almost needless last three hours of a great story.",

Galdalf takes him to Minas Tirith when he rides there to warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise an army large enough to assist in that coming battle.I thought that the battle of Helm's Deep was impressive but it seems a mere skirmish compared to the battle of Minas Tirith, here there are thousands of Orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant like creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under their giant feet.

Well, because the characters are already well-established and painted out on the screen by now, and the storyline is all chalked up. So everything was pitched for a homerun, and Peter Jackson did just that with \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\".There is such an abundance of action in the movie that you just lean back and enjoy the ride. The battle scenes are massive and well-choreographed, and at times it even feels like you are there on the battlefield amidst men, hobbits and orcs yourself.Needless to say that the sets, props and costumes are amazing here, just as they were in the previous two movies.The performances of the cast were good, as they had been in the previous movies as well. And it has been a blast to follow the characters and watch them in the quests and endeavors on the screen. And they had an abundance of really great actors and actresses to perform the various roles and bring their characters to life on the scree.For me this was a very full and wholeheartedly completion of the trilogy, one that had been so well lined up by Peter Jackson, and it delivered on all accounts.My rating for \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" is a solid eight out of ten stars.",

What I cannot forgive, however, is giving Legolas' superpowers during the Battle of Pelennor Fields and cutting out one of my favourite parts the book—Saruman's fate (I know Christopher Lee feels the same way!).Watching a poorly rendered elf leaping around with impossible ease on a CGI 'oliphaunt' before killing all on board and sliding down the trunk (allowing Gimli to make another wisecrack) is going a step too far in my book, reminding me of the awful digital excesses that were to follow in Jackson's next film, King Kong (shudder); rounding off the film without showing us what happens to Lee's evil white wizard and his slimy pal Grima Wormtongue is an even worse decision, one that leaves fans of the book wondering whether they fell asleep before the end and missed an entire chunk (yeah, yeah, I know this bit is in the extended edition, but I'm talking about the version I paid to see at the cinema!).The Return of the King is still a very impressive effort, with stunning battle scenes, a genuinely creepy giant spider, an army of ghosts, and a thrilling climax that takes place inside an erupting volcano, and I'm grateful to all involved for realising what many considered to be totally un-filmable, but I really wanted the last chapter to be the best of the lot.

        "text": "DVD, widescreen version, surround sound, big screen HDTV. So, it was almost like being in the theater. This final of the trilogy of LOTR movies is fitting but, like the others, a bit too ambitious in trying to cram in most of the contents of the books to please all the 'ringheads'. As a result, the story drags a bit in many places. And, when the climax comes, it is all a bit too cartoonish for my tastes. As in the other installments, the picture and sound are first-rate, some may call them 'reference quality.' The acting and directing are good, but perhaps they try to take this fairy tale a bit too seriously. It would be akin to taking Tom and Jerry cartoons seriously. Still, I am glad that I have the whole set of DVDs, I plan to re-watch certain scenes from time to time, but probably not the whole movie.I will give them to my great grandchildren, and they will wonder, \"What's a DVD?\"SPOILERS follow, for my recollection. As in the first movie, here I got bored with the huge, drawn-out battle scenes. What may work fine in our minds as we read a detailed book is presented in far too much length and detail in the movie. Second, there seems to be a bit too much reliance on viewers knowing something about the 'books.' For example, at the end (SPOILERS!!) when Frodo has to leave The Shire, we are not sure why, and that is such an important piece of the story. From what I now understand, his having been a bearer of the 'One Ring' placed him in a special category, eligible for a place across the waters which is a sort of 'heaven' where he can get R&R from his crusade to return the ring. Something he just could not get in The Shire. MORE SPOILERS: Another thing about the 'cartoon' aspect of the story. As we all know, when Frodo is at the mountain of fire, in such close proximity to the heat and sulfur fumes, he may have lasted 2 or 3 seconds at the most. We know from everything prior that he is normally mortal, a giant spider stings him, he gets cuts and abrasions to his face and torso, in essence having normal vulnerabilities. So, by rights he should also have burned up in the close proximity to the volcano, but doesn't even seem particularly hot. Which signals that the whole series of movies are cartoonish in basis, not to be taken too seriously.",

        "text": "In Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though heard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the past two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's grand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end.  The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron.  There is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on not just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga of the Lord of the Rings as a whole.  Though the film does carry quite a load to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the three in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the details of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this version, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there are plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on the visual effects as a whole that don't let up.  In all, ROTK is on the level with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole. This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to, that one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that preceded it.  It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would be very difficult to sit through it in one place.  Grade: A (both as a picture in and of itself, and overall on the three epics combined)",

        "text": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King brings Peter Jackson's mammoth adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic to a close in suitably epic fashion. epic fantasy-drama film directed by Peter Jackson that is based on the second and third volumes of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is the concluding film in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, following The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. As Sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of Middle-earth, Gandalf the Wizard, and Théoden King of Rohan rally their forces to help defend Gondor's capital Minas Tirith from the looming threat. Aragorn finally claims the throne of Gondor and summons an army of ghosts to help him defeat Sauron. Ultimately, even with full strength of arms, they realise they cannot win; so it comes down to the Hobbits, Frodo and Sam, to bear the burden of the Ring and deal with the treachery of Gollum. After a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous lands of Mordor, seeking to destroy the One Ring in the place it was created, the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.Notably, it won all eleven Academy Awards for which it was nominated, an Oscar record, and tied for largest number of awards won with Ben-Hur and Titanic.Instead of starting just where the previous film left off, however, it goes far back in time to the moment the tormented creature Gollum first came to possess the One Ring. In this flashback, actor Andy Serkis who voiced Gollum and performed his movements onset prior to the final CGI effects finally gets to appear on screen, portraying Gollum's former self, Sméagol. This disturbing scene serves as a potent reminder that the Ring seeks to corrupt even the well-intentioned Frodo, who is increasingly struggling with the dark power of the Ring himself. Thus, the film returns to the present, following Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they journey ever closer to the foreboding land of Mordor. They pass by the terrifying dark city of Minas Morgul, watching as the dreadful army of the Witch King sets out for the human strongholds in Gondor, and move on to the rocky stairs to Cirith Ungol, where an even darker enemy lies in wait. Meanwhile, the rest of the Fellowship reunites in Rohan, having defeated the wizard Saruman on two different fronts, at Helm's Deep and Isengard. They are not together for long, though, since the hobbit Pippin gets into trouble, making it necessary for him and Gandalf to hastily depart for Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor. Once there, they find the steward of Gondor, Denethor, in an unstable mental state and the city preparing for battle against the amassing forces of Sauron. Denethor unwisely sends his only remaining son, Faramir, back into bloody battle to prove himself. He returns nearly dead, sending Denethor over the edge of sanity.In another realm, elf Arwen begins her journey to immortal life in the Grey Havens, on her way to leave Middle-earth -- and Aragorn -- forever, but has a vision that causes her to once again reconsider her decision. Back in Rohan, the men are preparing to ride to Gondor's aide. Éowyn desperately wants to join the men in battle, but her uncle, King Théoden, orders her to stay and defend Rohan if necessary. The hobbit Merry also desires to ride with the men, but is denied due to his small size and inexperience. Aragorn is met there by the elf Elrond, who brings him the re-forged Sword that was Broken in the ancient battle with Sauron and urges him to take a different route to Gondor. Heeding Elrond's advice, Aragorn, along with elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli, takes a cavernous path through the mountains, where they meet ghoulish ghosts who betrayed Aragorn's ancestors and are doomed to eternal unrest unless they fulfill their broken oaths by aiding him. All but Frodo, Sam, and Gollum will meet on the massive battlefield of the Pelennor before the gates of Minas Tirith. The former three instead engage in a battle of wills between each other and the One Ring as they head toward the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it. The thrilling conclusion to what has become the film event of our time - - the definitive screen fantasy -- features more spellbinding moments, bigger battles, more emotion and more poetry than the terrific first two films in the trilogy.It is visually stunning as it pops your eyes, excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion.Jackson boldly and faithfully brought J.R.R. Tolkien's world to life as he's created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time as evidenced in this third film.Aside from that,the movie is great at all levels including the brilliance of the cast.Standing out amid an excellent cast is Elijah Wood, stymied by tweeness in the earlier films but here convincingly developing the character of Frodo as the embodiment of valor and self-sacrifice.Aside from that,it provides the viewer a great tale of heroes, bonded together by friendship and spectacular themes about very special friendship between hobbits Elijah Wood's Frodo and Sean Astin's Sam that touches us most of all.This is a masterpiece of filmmaking.",

        "text": "Spoilers herein.This raises the bar on production values, as it certainly is competently made, say, compared to the `Star Wars' stuff. It seems oddly paced, lacking a rhythm, and more importantly lacking the patina of magic that colored the first two. In fact, everything seems brighter this time out.Unlike the battle of the second, they have decided to not have any movie jokes, like the surfer/warrior who winks at the camera. But there is still a variety in tone from place to place as if different directors were involved. I suppose that's true.I remarked on the earlier films that they innovated primarily in how they use the vertical dimension. This third film is even more competent and extreme in that regard. They knew it was a discriminator and exploited it. Unfortunately, the towers and cities and mountain gates all have an unnatural sameness to them, they are photographed with huge vertical sweeps. Even the first ending where everyone bows to the hobbits and there is the obligatory `helicopter' shot, it goes shockingly far beyond what one expects. The way it pulls back fast and swoops reminds that we are used to an eye that is constrained by the aerodynamics of light helicopters.Not so here. When this is considered in hindsight, I'm pretty sure that the high production values won't be noticed; that all the effects and conventions here  especially the battle scenes  will be seen as borrowed, all except for the exhilarating use of height. That's worth watching. Magic of its own.That magic is enough to carry this project for me. It is clearly Jackson's intent to move his camera in great vertical arcs, usually in ways that no physical camera could. That gives us a fantastic eye. Just a few hours later, I saw `The Lion King' again and noticed that although they were never constrained by physics, they always moved the `camera' in ways we have seen in ordinary `real' films. That's because `Lion' wanted to look real while `Return' wanted to seem ultrareal.Ian McKellen has always puzzled me, he's sort of a working man's John Gielgud, an engineer of the spoken word. Here, he stoops to Alec Guiness' role. A sad way to cap a career.Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 3  Worth watching",

How else would he be able to make me forget my filthy and disgusting nicotine addiction ? He made me forget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew that with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for a record breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay winter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!I do conclude there are some people in the world who can`t see what the fuss is about with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy . My parents seem slightly puzzled that their cynical critical son loves LOTR . It`s simply explained , these epic movies aren`t a childish fantasy , they`re like David Lean filming a Shakespeare play , but I do take onboard the criticism that the story structure of the movies can be irritating . FELLOWSHIP is very stop-start while the action intercutting in TTT can be annoying but ROTK has probably the best pace and structure of the three . ROTK starts with a sequence showing Smeagol murdering his friend in order to get the ring . This gives some needed backstory to Gollum . It also sets up its stall that it`s not a family film never mind a \" childish fantasy \" . In fact I predict that many of the children in Rothesay cinema will be having nightmares tonight due to the scenes with that horrible big spider , it made my skin crawl and the woman sitting next to me was gasping out loud as it prepared to cocoon poor Frodo , you should have seen the Q for the toilet after that scene which tells you how convincing the FX are in this movie , nothing appears CGI : Gollum isn`t computer generated he`s a living being and Peter Jackson doesn`t use camera trickery for fight scenes he uses million upon millions of extras . He is David Lean reincarnated . No he is David Lean AND Will Shakespeare reincarnated , look at the way the cast act their parts , it`s like they`re appearing in the greatest play of the bard . Their performances are superlativeThere are some flaws . I did mention the script gives background to Smeagol but the script - Like the other films in the trilogy - is somewhat uneven . John Noble`s character Denethor seems somewhat underwritten and I wasn`t sure what his motivation was . Also as everyone else has mentioned the false endings are very irritating . When Aragorn is crowned king and the screen faded to black the audience reached for their Jackets and bags then we`re shown another scene lasting several minutes which faded to a blaze of music. Everyone reached for their bags and jackets , then another scene which... It would have been better to have seen Aragorn crowned King and then seen Frodo sailing into the distance but I guess after the screenwriters have irritated us with the abrupt endings of the first two movies it`s somewhat traditional to irritate with the end of the trilogy . These faults I can forgive but there is an unforgivable cop out of having an army of the undead charging to save the race of men from the Orc army at the end . It didn`t ruin the movie for me but it just seems so lazy and contrived which stopped me from thinking it was the best movie in the trilogy , it`s not , FELLOWSHIP is . But still this is a masterpiece of cinema which like cigarettes left me breathless and satisfied and hopefully we`ll see it sweep the Oscar ceremony at lastAs for the Oscars themselves I`m puzzled about a couple of things . Howard Shore`s score is beautiful and haunting but it`s far from original with much of the music in ROTK re-used from FELLOWSHIP ( The Gondor theme ) and TTT ( The Celtic music ) while the omissions are even more surprising . No nominations for any of the actors ! I know that all the great performances would cancel each other out but it`s shameful Andy Serkis wasn`t nominated as best supporting actor . Can anyone name a more unlikable baddie than Gollum in recent cinema ? Me neither and no nomination for cinematography ! I`ve no idea how John Lesnie`s camera was able to keep up with the action and he deserved at least a nomination so maybe we`ll see the third instalment robbed on Oscar night like FELLOWSHIP was . Even if it is that doesn`t stop me and millions of other film fans from recognising the genuis of Peter Jackson . I bow to you Sir",

It has some of the most amazing battle scene's in movie history. The word spectacular isn't good enough to describe it, it's breathtaking, epic and emotional involving. Who didn't wanted to pick up a sword and shield and charge with Aragorn towards a large number of Orcs for honor and glory?Even though the special effects are far from the best ever, Peter Jackson is a master in mixing the special effect with real life action. The use of it never feels overdone and the result is spectacular as well as believable.I think lot's of people were worried after \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" after seeing the battle of Helm's Deep. How was Peter Jackson ever going to top that great battle? Well, with \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" he topped it alright! The battle for Middle Earth is something you've never seen before. Greatest moment was when the riders of Rohan charged, it was really a moment in which you felt the true meaning of fighting and dying with honor. Also great moment during the immensely large battle were the fights against the oliphaunts, just when you thought the battle was over, those large creatures appeared! Really great moment.The characters are possibly at their best in this movie. No characters need introductions anymore and we get to see the deepest of their emotions in this movie, even Gollum's!Still the movie is not really deserving to be third in the top 250 here on IMDb.com. It's also not really deserving all those Oscar's it won. Like all The Lord of the Rings movies, it's great, spectacular and absolutely breathtaking at times but not classic masterpieces in my book.Also the movie is far from flawless. Once again the editing is just poor at times and what was with the ending? Couldn't they just think of one ending? I expected the end credits to start rolling multiple times during the ending but it just went on and on.Despite some of those flaws it still is an excellent movie with some unforgettable battle's sequence's.

        "text": "I haven't read anything by Tolkien. It is a great credit to these movies that you can watch all three without needing to have taken in the novels beforehand. This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish, and this moves rather smoothly, with great pacing. This is funny several times, and there is very little of the annoying(and still easily ignored) comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything you're seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable, in general, and the imaginative designs, and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark, this isn't actually depressing, in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense, well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography, and has a marvelous look. The acting doesn't let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this, and it might be too much for children. I recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre, and, really, everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10",

The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration.But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there.After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough. I think it says something about your endeavor when the most interesting character in the film is the one who's computer animated.The person who really deserves the most credit for this trilogy is its editor(s), who had to take god knows how many hours of footage and shape it into something resembling a movie.Grade: B",

Never has their been a more emotional fantasy film since the first STAR WARS trilogy with impressive feats of emoting largely thanks to Astin's loyal Sam (an Oscar nomination is in order for Best Supporting Actor) who truly loves his best friend Frodo; Tyler's heartbreaking Arwen in making a life or death decision; Otto's brave and championing turns in battle; Serkis' inspiring decisions as the cursed creature Gollum/Smeagol (in the latter's persona opening sequence shedding light in how corrupt the Ring truly is) and finally the valor of Mortensen as the titular warrior finding solace in the one universal truism: good conquers evil; love triumphs all! Fantastic battle sequences and heart-stopping moments of terror thanks to Frodo and Sam's encounter with the hideous giant spider Shelob are just a few worth mentioning moments of epic filmmaking at its best.

        "text": "Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to its epic conclusion in fine style: Frodo and Sam enter Mordor while the Battle of the Pelennor Fields begins, largely as a feint to draw Sauron's army away to allow the Ringbearer clear passage to Mount Doom. Following the Ring meeting its fate, all story lines are brought to their resolutions in a half hour or so of winding down.Jackson's visualisation of what happens inside Mount Doom is faithful to, and improves upon, Tolkien's source - once again, Tolkien threw away one of his set pieces in less than a page. The one false note is Gollum's final expression - I would have expected agony rather than \"Blimey! That's a bit of a surprise!\" There are at least five separate end-pieces - the Fellowship reunited, Aragorn's coronation, the return to the Shire, the Grey Havens, and Sam's return home (it is possible to argue at least a couple more). The film could have been ended on any of these, and there are those who argue that it should have been. But although the film could have ended there, the story could not, and credit to Jackson for adding a half hour capstone to a ten hour film in order to properly resolve all that should have been resolved.I feel this particularly strongly since this closing section contains two of my favourite moments. One is the moment in the tavern - the four Hobbits, traumatised by war, sit together in silence in stark contrast to the trivial carousing in the opposite bookend tavern scene in Fellowship. And the other is Frodo's final look back. If Elijah Wood never delivers another moment on screen as powerful as that one (and I'm sure he will), that is enough.A towering achievement in all respects.",

It is a film about promise as Aragorn leads the battle against progressing evil forces. Frodo and Sam quest to rid the ring into a fire. There are giant spiders, hovering dragons, towering ogres, trolls, and multi-tusked elephants all aimed at the film's exciting finale. Perhaps a few battles long, yet everything comes together with so much more meaning. That is all thanks to director Peter Jackson who seems to be adding not only the finishing touches to the trilogy but also a much needed crown jewel. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf the wizard who oversaw this quest from its core beginning. Solid returns by Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Sam who conflict with the Gollum while questing to finally destroy the ring. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn finally becomes King but not without a number of massive battles to prove its worthiness. Andy Serkis steals every scene consumed within the visual character of the Gollum, out to deceive our heroes and possess the ring. It drives a message of good over evil with courage, honor and glorious special effects. An impressive finish deserving many pleasant returns. Score: 9 / 10",

        "text": "RELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien's popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry. While I'm a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I've never read Tokien, likely because I'm not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien's writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982) and \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" (1991) with \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) sounds good, then you'll probably like these movies more than me. \"The Return of the King\" is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It's basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could've been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves. Like the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there's a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with \"The Two Towers,\" there's excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you'll likely appreciate this installment more than me. There are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they're also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. Then there are WAY too many \"looks of love\" between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There's also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one's fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling cliché? Another problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There's Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit's wife. \"Mythica: A Quest for Heroes\" (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God\" (2005). It's not rocket science. As noted above, the movie's needlessly overlong and things could've been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and \"looks of love\" are tacked on. Despite these honest quibbles, \"The Return of the King,\" and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like. THE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. GRADE: C",

This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all.  This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one.  This one has epic battles and great visuals as well.  It is also very well acted.  Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one.  All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch.

The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than fitting; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance. Almost nothing disappointed or bothered me. All parts of the story were equally interesting. It was sweeping, it was involving, it was beautiful. One of the few thing I would complain about is the villain. Sauron is boring and more or less unseen. He does not feel very threatening. And his army of orcs has been dull since the first film. They're just not very interesting creatures. Fortunately, The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with a gallery of better ones. Some of them have been present in the other two films, trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on. They're more present here, however. Even better, though, those gigantic elephants, ten times the size of a normal one. Oh, man, those are cool. Star Wars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from Empire, and they are. One scene where Legolas, the elf, triumphs over one of them feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack. But the very best thing is a giant spider. Everyone knows that there was originally a giant spider on skull island in King Kong, cut from the film because it really disturbed a test audience. Seeing the spider in Return of the King is like having that famous piece of lost footage restored. When all three films are finally out on their special edition DVDs, I'm going to spend a month combing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't just as good as this one, or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends have sworn they were.",

        "text": "I am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I  have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for  life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at  school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great  pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least  fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and  sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this  genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck  me as being among the worst films ever made.  I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The  Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from  the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's  vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and  fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of  that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for  parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has  disappointed me.  The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a  review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic  ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark  Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to  obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by  the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be  used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final  part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the  kingdom of Gondor.  The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this  leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen,  even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the  film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many  films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not  neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding.  Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best  possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard  Shore's memorable musical score.  So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this  should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled  the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best  director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the  competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and  the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah  Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls  the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting  Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal  companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo  Mortensen or Bernard Hill.  Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed?  Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no  doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great  cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly  inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.",

        "text": "Before I review this good movie, I have to get something that's been bothering me off my chest.I went with eight people to see \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\" All eight of them found it \"good\" at best. We all thought it was too long, with too many passages of dialogue explaining what was going to happen (\"I ride to Minis Tirith at dawn to face the enemies of Middle-Earth!\" -- just do it already!), too many scenes that most definitely could have been cut or edited, and we all found that the ending of the film stretched on too long and we didn't need to see Frodo and Sam fondly gazing at each other ninety times before we got the idea that they have an affection for each other. (Brotherly love or...something else?)The thing is, all the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies are good. But none of them are great. Filmed by Peter Jackson with an epic feeling that betrays J.R.R. Tolkien's light-hearted tale, the films try to take a somewhat light idea and turn them into epics -- a problem, since the entire world is fantasy, and it is hard to take anything in the film dreadfully serious. (I thought it was just I, but some other critics have noted the same problem.)This is the best \"Lord of the Rings\" movie. Even though it sounds as if I am complaining about them, I am not. I'm complaining about the way movie geeks flock to the cinemas and spread word that it's the \"best film of all time,\" then post these comments on the Internet and try to boost the film's rating on IMDb. (Some fans have been caught in the act of making multiple usernames to do so.)I find it almost laughable that anyone could argue that the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy is the best of all time, or that it is the better than \"The Godfather\" (because that film stands as the number one film on the Internet Movie Database, there are heated debates from \"Rings\" fans claiming that \"The Godfather\" is trash and their favorite film is not).It's all opinion, of course, but I sometimes wonder whether the fans of \"The Lord of the Rings,\" those who claim they are superior to \"The Godfather,\" have even seen that film. I also wonder whether the strict fans that claim it is the best film ever made have actually seen enough films to qualify for that assumption -- if it is their favorite film, fine, but to say it is THE best film of all time is entirely their opinion, although they seem to take it as a fact.  Have they seen the films of Fellini? Kurosawa? Scorsese? Coppola? \"Citizen Kane\"? \"Casablanca\"? \"Taxi Driver\"? \"Sweet Smell of Success\"? \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"? \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"? \"Chinatown\"? \"Apocalypse Now\"? \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"? The list goes on!Their definitions of classics range from the time of \"Star Wars\" to present cinema. It may sound like an old argument but it's true -- greater films are harder to find nowadays, and just because \"The Lord of the Rings\" seems like an achievement of some sort, it does not make it the best film of all time. I can name many better films. But, then again, it's my opinion, I suppose.Now that I'm done with my rant, there's nothing left to say. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) venture closer to Mordor to destroy The One Ring, while Gollum (Andy Serkis) plots to murder them both and take the Ring of Power for himself. (We get to see Gollum's background in the film, too, which is something that will satisfy Tolkien's fans that have read the stories.)Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) returns to the throne of a kingdom (hence the title of the film) to claim his position as heir of Isildur, but first gathers together Legolas and Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) to help battle the Orcs venturing closer to their castle, along with Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), who opens a can of whoop [butt] in this movie.This is the darkest film of the trilogy. You may have thought \"The Two Towers\" was dark, but \"The Return of the King\" is almost evil -- Frodo gives audiences the creeps a few times. When he says, \"The Ring is mine,\" and grins at Sam with the Elijah Wood grin, a shiver goes down your spine.The film picks up pace starting with the giant arachnid battle, about halfway through the film, and continues down the path of mild greatness until the last twenty minutes, which never seem to end. It is as if Jackson was afraid to close his film for a final time and kept dragging the scenes out -- I don't need to see Frodo and Sam admiring each other more than twice!As the credits rolled, the audience poured out of the theater. \"Wasn't that good?\" I heard someone say. \"No,\" was the reply. \"The Return of the King\" is a very good film, and certainly the best of the trilogy, but don't be fooled by the hype -- this is not one of the best films of all time. It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- some day, someone's going to realize that what they're going on about isn't really there at all. And finally all the film fans will be able to say, \"Y'know, I never really loved the movie all that much anyway.\" But for now, I guess we'll all have to put up with more unearned hype. I liked this movie. I liked it a lot at certain points. But I would never, ever call it great. That's just me, I guess.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",

And although each movie has a very long running time it went by really quickly. Even if the movies in this trilogy seemed long, it was so engrossing and enthralling to the point you could hardly notice the long length of these movies. In fact it seemed to go by way faster than the movie actually is. This third movie in the movie is indeed a grand finale and is another epic film in the trilogy that really leaves a mark. It ties up the loose ends quite well and most definitely has the feel of a epic final installment. Some may complain that this movie has too many endings to it, which I thought the same at first. But for a long epic journey as this the ending is very important and I can see why Jackson wanted to tie up every loose ends without having a ambiguous ending. And when it comes down to it, the whole journey is mainly Frodo's story not Aragorn. But even I gotta admit I got up in theater like the rest of the audience since I really thought the movie was over because of the multiple endings. One of the audience actually stood up than sat back down shouting \"when is this going end\" which got the audiences laughing. Anyways the movie overall was just amazing, even the battle sequences was just jaw dropping. It's about the same level as the battle for Helm's Deep but has a bit more cool and memorable sequences going for it. There is a lot of one liners in this movie especially by Sam but those one liners leave a impact and moves the emotions without being forced and it works here as well. I have said this before on my other reviews for this trilogy. But I will say it again, watching the extended edition is crucial for this movie and it explains a lot for the characters actions. It has lot of the key scenes that are missing from the theater release. But there are some random bits that even the extended edition couldn't cover up, the part about Eowyn and Faramir isn't developed very well and just comes off plain random while watching. I know Jackson wanted to focus on the core of the story but that just came off random and not developed enough like few other scenarios in the movie. Anyways although this third installment has a lot of action in it, there is a lot of story going on in the background as well. And has messages and intriguing plot even before the main action takes place, and the action let me tell you is very cleverly crafted. And it's just amazing to watch, just the battle sequences alone is worth the price of admission when it hit theaters. It's the last film in the trilogy and by now the audiences got use to the characters and although the development of the characters aren't entirely fleshed out to the point you actually care for the characters and the cause. Sort of like after playing a long RPG game and is satisfied and sort of sad when it ends, you get the same feeling with this movie. This trilogy is a epic masterpiece and the last installment has got to be the most uplifting one out of the three films, although I liked \"Fellowship\" the most. This is a grand finale and the conclusion to a epic journey that should not be missed, although anyone who enjoyed the first film in this trilogy will most definitely watch the whole trilogy anyways. It's simply inevitable.9.1/10",

        "text": "'The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King (2003)' is the best of the three mainly because it is, for the most part, so pacy and persistently forward-moving. It's constantly engaging and does a good job of wrapping up its story in a suitably epic and entertaining way. It does suffer from multiple endings, though. These could each have done the job (except for the one that's particularly silly) but none of them wrap up the picture especially well in conjunction with one another. There's also an occasional feeling that there's less plot this time around, with more emphasis placed upon phenomenally epic battles - some of the largest in scale I've ever seen. However, this one is more of an ensemble piece than the others and it intercuts between its main stories just often enough that you always care about each of its never-more-interesting dangling threads. Although the emphasis of this picture does seem slightly less on our protagonist's journey to rid Middle Earth of the one ring than you'd perhaps expect, it strikes a balance between all of its characters - especially those who were sidelined before - and makes sure that they all have something important to do and that you care about them while they are doing it. Because of this, it's the most character-focused in the trilogy, even if some of the 'main' players are given slightly less to do. Thankfully, it also means that Sam, who is clearly the most heroic of the hobbits, finally has his day as a hero (even if most other characters don't acknowledge it) and it is incredibly satisfying. 8/10",

        "text": "`The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' - though, in my view, not quite as compelling as the monumental `The Two Towers' that directly preceded it - is, nevertheless, a worthy conclusion to this one-of-a-kind cinematic achievement.  In the final installment of the trilogy, the hobbit Frodo, his loyal companion, Sam, and the nefarious cretin Gollum, are still heading toward Mount Doom to destroy the ring which threatens to hold the world in its diabolical grasp.  Meanwhile a whole host of other characters do further battle with the forces of evil massing to take over Middle Earth.Under Peter Jackson's skillful directorial guidance, never have the resources of cinema  cinematography, art direction, matte design, special effects  been marshaled with more effectiveness in bringing a fantasy world to vivid life.  As with `The Two Towers,' the eyes pop and the jaw drops at the sheer magnificence of the spectacle taking place on screen.  The seemingly endless vistas, sweeping camera movements, ferocious battle sequences and one truly terrifying giant spider offer some of the most visually astonishing moments in motion picture history.  It will be a long time before we encounter a film project of this size and scope again.What struck me most while watching `The Return of the King' was how Tolkien had created a view of the Middle Ages as it might have been had Christianity never existed  a view that film, by its intrinsically visual nature, only enhances.  As the camera scans the horizon, we are struck by the fact that there are no cathedrals, no country churches, no spires dominating the landscape.  In a similar way, there are no clergy present, no Christian symbols such as crosses or rosary beads, no sacred artwork  all visuals that define our image of the Middle Ages.  Instead of priests there are wizards and elves; instead of crucifixes, we find magic rings and New Age medallions.   `The Return of the King' allows us to re-imagine a period in history, bereft of the single most dominating influence that came to define that era.  It's still the classic battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil that have defined human history - but as filtered through Tolkien's Teutonic imagination and vision, that conflict becomes the stuff of mythology and legend.In the mass of special effects, it's easy to overlook the fine performances of Elijah Woods as Frodo, Sean Astin as Sam, and Andy Serkis as Gollum, who together provide the heart and soul needed to keep this sprawling epic tale life-sized and moving.   If truth be told, impressive as this film undoubtedly is, a certain  perhaps inevitable - fatigue factor does creep in during portions of this third installment.  Perhaps the elements that seemed so fresh in `The Two Towers'  the epic battle scenes, on a scale far grander than any we had ever before encountered, or the schizophrenic conflict between good and evil being waged inside Gollum's twisted psyche  seem like just more of the same here.  Unlike the second part, `The Return of the King' provides little that is new to take us to that higher level we keep hoping for and expecting.That being said, I must also add that the emotional impact of the final moments is simply overwhelming, as the characters we have come to know and love over the course of the tale engage in the most moving scenes of leave-taking and parting since `The Wizard of Oz' and `E.T.'  There are some who have balked at the sentimental nature of these moments, calling them anticlimactic and self-indulgent, yet after having invested so much time getting to know these characters and sharing in their adventure, the audience has earned the right to a bit of over-the-top sentiment, and I see no reason to criticize the filmmakers for pulling out all the emotional stops here.  If anything, these scenes demonstrate the intense bond Jackson and his crew have forged with their legions of loyal, appreciative fans.There's no doubt about it, taken as a whole, this nine-hour-plus saga of `The Lord of the Rings' is one of the great epic experiences of our time.",

I had watched the first one, found it as dull and overlong as the book it was based on, watched the second only because I like Gollum but found it dull as well, and figured that was enough. But after I read that the final film of the trilogy had won 11 Oscars I thought that even though the Oscars aren't that reliable I ought to take a look.And from the first, mesmerizing portrayal of Gollum's back story, I absolutelly love this one. It is an exciting, action-packed movie with epic battles and great special effects.The weakest part of the movie is it's peaceful final scenes. If you are deeply immersed in the story they are probably offer a satisfying emotional payoff, but if you're just there for the dragons and the ogres then none of it's that interesting. But that's a small part of a movie that is otherwise wall-to-wall action.Even if you're not a LOTR fan I'd recommend checking this out. You don't need more than a general notion of the thrust of the trilogy to watch this. It's been 15 years since I saw the last movie and 40 since I read the books, but even not being clear on who everyone was didn't cause much confusion.\nIf you're new to LOTR: There's a quest, there's a hobbit, there's a wizard.

        "text": "I can't talk about the film as much as I want, I'm afraid I wouldn't get the name rights, the locations or the characters who weren't there from the start, I'm even afraid some events or scenes escaped my attention, but I know I love poetry, and the last twenty minutes reminded of these words from Du Bellay.\"Happy the man who, journeying far and wide As Jason or Ulysses did, can then Turn homeward, seasoned in the ways of men, And claim his own, and there in peace abide!\"This is one of the most famous verses of French Renaissance and I can't think of a movie that captures the innermost joy and relief of homecoming as the third and final installment of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy did. Even the title carries this regal glory and satisfyingly conclusive nature. And through this \"Return of the King\", Aragorn, to name him, also ends the journey of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Gollum and so many names that, two years earlier, could only -no pun intended- ring a bell among Tolkien's readers. I know they were many of them as we're talking of the most outstanding work of fiction from the second half the 20th century, but I suspect Peter Jackson multiplied the number of fans by a two-digit number, with a cinematic wizardry of Gandalfian proportions. Extending my statement about Jackson in the first film's review, there's indeed more than a hobbit within the New Zealand director.But for honesty's sake, and not to spoil my enthusiasm, I must confess I never read Tolkien's books, I've never been into medieval and Fantasy world anyway, although I know the story wasn't intended to venture in the realm of magic and fantasy alone. I enjoyed the first movie because it pushed me into a world daringly unique and imaginative, but so obsessed with its own reality that it almost confined to realism. More than the plot, I cared for the characters, because they seemed \"to have a story before the story\", they were not cardboard heroes or villains; they were archetypal but never at the expense of depth and obscurity. Despite these strengths, I welcomed the second film with perplexity because the surprise was gone and the entertaining value was inevitably hanging on the set-ups from the first film and the expectation of the third, situations that were no-more or that were yet-to-come. Unlike its two predecessors, the final film is great on its own. Everything has been said about the visual imagery and on that level, with the magnificent shots, battle sequences and that defining image of Gandalf the Grey arriving at Minas Tirith, Jackson really pushed the envelope and broke new grounds in the field of special effects, CGI wouldn't be a curse word anymore. But all the sets of skills in the world wouldn't amount to anything without a story.Indeed, I was surprised by how moving the final act was. The last thirty minutes of \"The Return of the King\" provided some of the most emotional moments of the last twenty years, something whose resonance transcends the limits of the Fantasy genre. And that's an even greater achievement than special effects, Jackson had created characters who had their own special effect, built over the course of two movies, that equals the lengths of three actually, allowed us to get emotionally involved with them. I compared Gandalf with Obi-Wan in the first opus' review but he doesn't deserve any comparison, he's in a class of his own. The bravery of Aragorn, the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, the torment of Gollum and of course, the friendship between Sam and Frodo could finally culminate.And in this glorious gallery, Sam is perhaps the unsung hero of the film because he suffered no fear or hesitation, he was Frodo's guardian angel with unshakable loyalty from beginning to end, and never let his ego trespass in his sense of duty. Of all the characters, this is the one I had a soft spot on, and from the ending, I have the feeling, this is what the long epilogue was trying to convey as without him, all the battles and desperate efforts would have lead to nowhere and forget about the ring, his smile and satisfaction in the end, is perhaps the true emotional reward. Indeed, the Ring was only a plot-driver, the film is about people, who overcome the adversity and come full circle with their own personalities, who seek for the peace of the world, for their own peace's sake. And what a price for peace! What a magnificent journey coming to an end, and what a satisfying ending! The first two films ended with interrogation marks, with an urge to see more, there was excitement, but an excitement pending over the reception of the next opus, undermined by the uncertainty. This film closes the chapter and leaves with overwhelming emotions and inner satisfaction; it is a \"The End\" in the tradition of Hollywood epics. And this glorious finale redeems all the flaws or the little imprecision from the first, all the removed chapters or cut sections. Speaking of Hollywood, the film is also known for being the third to get eleven Oscars (including Best Picture) with other classics like \"Ben Hur\" and \"Titanic\" I guess it is the reward of the whole trilogy, whose last opus was the apotheosis, something that proved that cinema had this unique capability to transport you into a world where imagination and reality made one. And Peter Jackson is one name to be chanted by the bards of the \"Lord of the Rings\" Pantheon, for he ensured the popularity of the saga, by translating it into a new language, a new medium. This was a Herculean task that the third hobbit, third wizard, third cinematic genius marvelously accomplished for one of the best cinematic thirds ever.",

However, in my opinion it fails to be the masterpiece that some viewers see in it. For the many of us who did not read the book the plot is still not very much more than a legend, which fails to bear too deep meanings. And although the last series is a little bit more human and touching than the previous ones, many of the characters are still one-dimensional. The biggest failure is however the ending - very long and redundant. If the film ended 20 minutes earlier, it would have been better.\nNevertheless, these minus points are small compared to the high level of the camera work, visual and sound effects and production.

        "text": "It's hard to imagine that anyone would join 'The Lord of the Rings' saga so late in its on-screen life, so if you've never heard of this tale (there must be at least one of you!) then I suggest you begin with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and take it from there. However, if, like the rest of us, you've been closely following the story of 'Middle Earth' where two innocent hobbits are carrying an evil ring of power to its destruction, then you'll be desperate to see how it ends. Although, based on what most people seem to think about the trilogy overall, 'The Return of the King' appears to be most people's favourite (worth noting that mine is 'The Two Towers!').Maybe it's because the source material (J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy of novels) has already been written that the concluding chapter is so good. Many stories start out with much promise and tend to die off (see the last series of 'Game of Thrones!'). Luckily, this doesn't happen here. Everything and everyone that made the saga great comes together and gives the audience the perfect ending that they deserve.Yes, purists of the book may argue about the odd creative liberty here and there which has been taken when transferring it to the big screen, but, more often than not, everything lands where it should. Re-watching the trilogy today (nearly twenty years after its release) I noticed that some of the special effects in the first film ('Fellowship') didn't look quite so good as they did at the time (i.e. more green screen-ish), yet this final chapter seems as perfect as it was in its day.There are so many fine performances in 'Return of the King' that it's hard to pick a favourite. In the first two movies I always preferred the human characters, such as Gandalf and Aragorn (and, of course, the computer-generated Gollum in 'The Two Towers'). Yet now, I really felt more of a connection to the two hobbits - Frodo and Sam. Following their journey I really did get a sense of how much they'd suffered here - a rare feat nowadays when so many on-screen heroes seem to be able to absorb inhuman amounts of punishment with barely a ruffled head of hair (and don't get me started on Disney's 'Star Wars' trilogy).As I said before, you really need to watch the first film to know if you'll truly enjoy its conclusion and, if you do, then 'Return of the King' will certainly not disappoint. It has everything from great character-acting, to excellent special effects and a perfect setting and direction. Not since the ORIGINAL 'Star Wars' trilogy has a set of films come together so spectacularly.",

        "text": "Quentin Tarantino's gallery of grotesques is definitely a strange film to watch. Breaking many of the modern rules of a film - there are four interlocking stories instead of one, the subject matters tackled are extremely adult and may not be to everybody's taste - it's a wonder that the film succeeds, but in the end PULP FICTION has to be one of the best films of the 1990s. As much as we would like to ignore it, this is what the world is like today, full of drugs, violence and hostility, and it's about time a film faced up to the real world. PULP FICTION does just this.I liked three of the stories, but the one involving Travolta and Thurman left me cold I'm afraid. For a start, it's far too long and needlessly talky (about nothing in particular), and could have been cut down a lot. It seems to take ages to get to the actual horror of the piece (Thurman's drug overdose and subsequent heart injection), and when that moment comes, it's over extremely quickly. There is no particularly memorable dialogue here, either.The surrounding story, where the couple hold up a restaurant, is perfectly set up, and the final moments, where Jackson holds up the robbers himself, does show some of Tarantino's genius as Jackson quietly discusses the situation with his would-be robbers in a matter-of-fact way. The story of Travolta and Jackson trying to clear up their 'mess' is an excellent piece of black comedy, well-timed and with a scene-stealing performance from Harvey Keitel as the Wolf. Bruce Willis' story is very good too, with some unexpected twists in the tale and some harrowing scenes.There's a catchy jukebox score and an ensemble cast to liven things up too. The cast list is a reading of '90s talent: John Travolta in his comeback film; Samuel L Jackson was relatively unheard-of then; Uma Thurman proved herself as a woman to be reckoned with; Bruce Willis lent another world-weary performance to his CV, and none the worse for it; Ving Rhames also proved himself as an up-and-coming actor; Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer were cool and hysterical in equal measures; Harvey Keitel stole the show as clear-up man; Quentin Tarantino put in a twitchy cameo appearance which wasn't as nearly as bad as everybody said; Eric Stoltz was memorable as a stoned drug addict...the list is endless, really. There are other names I miss out in the interests of space.While Tarantino's rapid-fire dialogue is as sharp as ever (his decision to have the hit men talk about normal, everyday things like Quarter Pounders and Big Macs instead of \"gangster stuff\" was very clever), it is the succession of odd images which really stay in the mind, such as Travolta accidentally blowing apart someone's head; Willis and Rhames fighting, escaping into a spare-part shop and getting attacked; Thurman's adrenaline injection and the hysteria surrounding it; and finally Roth and Plummer getting the tables turned on them. All of these moments help to make PULP FICTION an endearing slice of cinema, which I'm sure will be remembered as a minor classic in years to come.",

        "text": "Pulp Fiction (1994) **** (out of 4) Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the \"real\" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that \"Bad Motherf&*&er,\" which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age.",

Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. It sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. I found Fargo to be a hilarious film as well. Is there something wrong with me?",

        "text": "\"Pulp Fiction\" is an American film from 1994, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year and the director here is of course Mr. Quentin Tarantino, who made this film around the age of 30 and it was his 3rd filmmaking effort already, although most people have not really heard of his first work and only know Reservoir Dogs from his very early years. Anyway, this one here is the one that not only brought him a Palme d'Or, but also introoduced him to and kept him at the Oscars for years, no decades to come. Until this day, in fact. So lets take a look at what is most memorable about Pulp Fiction. I think last night was maybe the third time I watched this movie and the first time at a theater. It's a really long film at over 2.5 hours, but it does feel shorter for sure and that is almost a given as this film is still in the imdb top10 hightest-rated movies, currently at #8, but it was even top5 a few years ago I think. Anyway, by now it's been rated by 1.7 million voters. Enough said about the movie's popularity. So many have seen it.As for the film's success with awards bodies, I already mentioned something, but it also needs to be said that Tarantino won a Screenplay Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA for his writing and that is of course a huge trifecta achievement and he was really young back then, so truly nice that he certainly delivered in the decades afterwards. I cannot really think of one filmmaker these days around the age of 30 with such a bold unique approach to filmmaking. You can really see in almost every scene how big of a film nerd Tarantino is. And his cast here profited a lot from that too. Travolta got an Oscar nomination. He deserved it. Uma Thurman did too and I am not so sure about her. Love her in Kill Bill and recent films where she is a scene stealer with very little screen time when working with Lars von Trier, but I don't know if her performance here is really good enough for a nomination, even if I am quite fond of her in general. And then there is Samuel L. Jackson of course. Everybody who knows him (only) as Nick Fury needs to see his works with Tarantino. He is so good in here, such a memorable character, easily the best from the film. And he worked a lot with Q afterwards too. His turn in the Foxx/DiCaprio/Waltz western is also magnificent. But back to this one here: I would say basically the first scene when he and Travolta enter the apartment is when the film is at its best. Judging from this one only, I would have given 4 stars out of 5 and said it is one of my favorite films of the year, but sadly it does not stay that great when we have the Butch scenes (even if also for Willis, it is a contender for career-best) and also the long sequence with Travolta and Thurman and also the final scene at the restaurant again with SLJ.Now I would like to speak about a few very specific scenes and moments and, in general, inclusions that stayed in my mind here. First of all, the restaurant with all these waiters in costume was amazing. I totally wanna go there. Did not even recognize Buscemi as Buddy Holly, even if I knew he worked with Q in Reservoir Dogs. Another great actor. Same for Harvey Keitel, even if he is not one of my favorites like Buscemi. Still Mr. Wolf is such an icon. When SLJ's character hears Marsellus is sending the Wolf, it is so hilarious. We know immediately that dude is a respectable fella who knows exactly what he is doing. I'd be happy to have Mr. Wolf bark orders at me and he also would have deserved his own film. I think he had a little cameo in another Tarantino work. This character has aged really well, just like the film as a whole. Then the food: The Kahuna Burger even makes me as a vegetarian immediately wanna take a bite. And that milkshake at the restaurant! Totally worth it. Kinda hilarious by today's standards how five bucks is a lot of money for a milkshake back then. But boy is it worth it. Even Vincent agrees. Speaking of Vincent, there is a lot I can say about him. Not just his funny posture at the Wallace residence that has been used for many memes, but also for example how keeping stuff secret when everybody goes their own way is something that occurs twice after somewhat memorable events during which characters are in life-threatening situations. You will know what I mean when you see the scenes. But an act of courage and integrity by one character (even if it is indirectly also about saving one's own life in both scenarios) saves the other person too.As for Tarantino: He once again also acts in here just like he did in some of his movies, also the much later one with Waltz, SLJ and Leo I mentioned earlier. There his inclusion is probably even more fun than here. But I still loved how he makes fun of himself directing in this one we got here during the water splashing scene near the end when he is basically directing Keitel in-character. Hilarious moment. Coincidence is also a big factor in this film we have here. What if... can be asked on so many occasions. What if the girl (the stunning Maria de Medeiros) had not forgotten the ring? Vega would not have been killed and actually this really put major emphasis on SLJ's character's decision. Had he not retired, could he have been there too, killed Butch and saved Vega? What if Vega had not left the gun in the room? What if Butch had never run into Marsellus when driving back to his girl. What if all these bullets had not missed the two during the apartment? What if Vega had not accidentally killed the boy in the car. No Tarantino and Keitel in this film then. And they would not have ended at the restaurant where in the end the circle really closes and even if I do prefer chronological films most of the time, there is no denying the lack of chronology here works very well. For example we see Vega knowing he is going to die later on. Charming moment also between Willis and Travolta when they meet for the first time.Okay, now one aspect and recurring joke I want to talk a bit about too.: Vincent Vega's toilet breaks. Every time he takes a bathroom break, catastrophe ensues outside really. Be it Mia ODing, the guys at the restaurant launching their robbery or Butch entering the apartment making toast for himself. Or indirectly also the guy at the apartment who storms outside. Okay this is not Vega taking a toilet break, but still the bathroom is really an aspect there too. This really shows you the bizarre humor Tarantino includes in his movies all the time. Kinda symbolic how toilets are significant here. And Vega apparently also does not have the best bladder or bowel movement with hof often he goes. He even asks for a toilet break at his dealer's apartment after they reached an agreement. Hilarious stuff. There are many other scenes about which you will laugh. Like for example when we see Marsellus with heavy injuries from the accident \"walk\" towards Butch in order to kill him and he walks like a zombie basically firing left and right. Or the toast moment I just mentioned giving us a parallel on what/who is finished that very moment. Or also the anecdote told by Walken's character about the gold watch. I mean it is meaningful, even historically meaningful in a sense, but at the same time it is also a reference on a guy hiding a watch for years in his butthole. It's kinda gross humor, but never childish fart humor or something like that. There is so much creativity and even intellect to it that it is a really great achievement and I am happy Tarantino received all this awards recognition for his work here. By the way, it is also a rare occurence that he is not the only one credited with the script.Finally, still one minor scene that stayed in the head for me, namely how they say when they enter the apartment (where a familiar face from NCIS is in btw.) they should have brought bigger guns because there are many thugs inside (also referenced later when there was one more than they expected, so Q even delivered in terms of mathematics) and with how Vega actually brought a big gun for one enemy (i.e. for a big gun) to Butch's apartment, but it wasn't enough, so taking care of your gun and situation is eventually more important than what kind of firearm(s) you bring. And the (non-chronological) ending scene is also memorable not just again for Jackson (even if I prefer him laying actual gun vengeance on people), but also because it is pretty much the only scene and sequence in which nobody is injured and people leave the restaurant all safe and sound, despite all the potential violence that could have happened in this scene, which also shows again that SLJ's character has sort of found his path to God. And there is no bloodshed. This would be all for my review then. I am a bit sad the film did not stay as strong as it started, but it is still a big fun ride and I recommend checking it out to everybody, even if it is not one of my favorites from Tarantino. SLJ's portrayal alone makes it worth watching I think and if you are one of the 3 or 4 on this planet who haven't seen it yet, then totally go for it or I will lay my vengeance upon you! Thumbs up.",

Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that God's hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side. \"Pulp Fiction\" is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (\"Pulp Fiction\", \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and the winner and weakest \"Forrest Gump\") with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. \"Pump Fiction\" saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult \"Reservoir Dogs\". The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Pulp Fiction – Tempo de Violência\" (\"Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence\")",

        "text": "Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable.",

Also, while we were watching it, I was cracking up at the language - I can't even count how many curse words they used. This is one movie that will probably never get shown on network TV - they would probably have to cut more than half the movie (including Samuel L.

        "text": "Quentin Tarantino presents his masterpiece: interwoven tales of a washed-up boxer, some bodyguards to powerful crime kingpin, and others who cross their path on this fateful day. Featuring an all-star cast: John Travolta in his best role (relaunching his dead career), Sam Jackson in his defining role (still trying to outdo himself fourteen years later), Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and more. (Many of these being Tarantino regulars, who work well with his idiosyncratic style.) How do I review a film so many people have praised, including my hero Roger Ebert? I could be a detractor and say its a bad film, but I'd be lying. I love the story and how it all plays out. I still prefer Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\", but this comes in a close second. (Sadly, I don't think he ever recovered after he became famous. Subsequent films -- \"Jackie Brown\", \"Kill Bill\" and \"Death Proof\" -- all have a certain charm to them, but are not close to being on the level of \"Dogs\" or \"Pulp\".) Although I've seen this movie, or at least bits of it, a dozen times, I think the most recent may be the most interesting. I watched it with a young woman who saw Bruce Willis and asked who he was. I said, \"Bruce Willis.\" She asked who that was. I listed a few of his bigger films (\"Die Hard\", \"Armageddon\", etc.) but she said she had not seen them. How a woman in her 20s does not know Bruce Willis or any of his movies is beyond me, but it got me wondering: would \"Pulp Fiction\" be a different film if I didn't recognize the majority of the actors? Walken, for example, appeals to me because he's Walken. Would his monologue be as good if delivered by someone else or by Walken when I didn't know him by name? Curious thought.If you haven't seen \"Pulp Fiction\", see it. Tarantino is a better writer than a director, but this film offers probably his best directing to date and some superb writing. He is very dialogue-intensive, which I think alienates some viewers (particularly in \"Death Proof\"), but give him a fair shake. This film defined the 1990s and continues to be influential in film today. Pay attention and you'll be sure to see why.",

        "text": "I think the title of the film relates to foreign New Wave film, and magazines, well the film starts with the definitions. Anyway, this is a brilliant crime drama from Oscar winning writer (along with Roger Avary) and Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Quentin Tarantino. The story begins with what will be a continuing scene towards the end where Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) plan the robbery of the cafeteria they are in. After the opening credits, with the song \"Jungle Boogie\" we see hit men Vincent Vega (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Samuel L. Jackson) on their way to see one of their boss's associate's to retrieve the stolen valuable briefcase (we never see what it is, but from the reflecting colour it looks like gold), asking questions about their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), and after Jules popular bible passage recitation killing two of the double-crossers. It then skips to Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) who is paid to throw a boxing match, and Vincent comes in, leading to another story. Vincent is taking Marcellus's wife Mia (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Uma Thurman) for the evening, in which they win a dance contest, she snorts what she thought was cocaine, but it was heroin, and she is revived with adrenalin at the house of drug dealer Lance (Eric Stoltz). It then flashes back to (what would be the opening of the film) young Butch receiving his father's watch from Capt. Koons (Christopher Walken) who tells him they both shoved it up their arses to keep it safe. Then it forwards to Butch's fight, and he did not throw it, and he escapes the city, there is a moment where Butch has to go back to his house when his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria De Medeiros) forgot his watch, and he kills Vincent who was waiting for him. Driving back though, he also encounters Marcellus himself, but before they can kill each other, they are kidnapped and tied up by two homosexuals, one is Zed (The Mask's Peter Greene). Butch manages to escape and save Marcellus from continued torture and male rape, and this is when their dept is settled, as long as Butch leaves town for good. The final flashback goes back to just after Jules has killed Lance, and another guy from the cupboard comes out shooting, but no bullets hit. After killing him, and taking Marvin (Phil LaMarr) with them, they have another problem where Vincent accidentally shoots their hostage. To help clear up the mess they go to the house of Jimmie Dimmick (Tarantino) and call for help from the guy who can \"solve problems\", Winston 'The Wolf' Wolfe (Harvey Keitel). They manage to clear up the mess, and have to wear new, dorky clothes, and going to a cafeteria everything seems fine, till Pumpkin and Honeybunny start the robbery (that you saw at the beginning), and eventually after a long chat and guns pointing Jules and Vincent stop them, before leaving, and that is the end. Phew! I would have explained it all in the chronological order, but that would be complicated for those who don't know it. Also starring Rosanna Arquette as Jody and Steve Buscemi as Buddy Holly. Tarantino's direction and script, where characters seem normal, e.g. talking about popular culture (like burgers) is brilliant, all actors are perfectly cast, and it is just an unmissable mainstream film. The memorable quotes, besides Jules's bible recitation, \"Bring out the Gimp\" and \"They call it a \"Royale with Cheese\".\" (both nominated to be in 100 Years, 100 Quotes), are \"Zed's dead baby. Zed's dead.\" and \"Oh man, I shot Marvin in the face\" - \"Why the f*** d'you do that!\" Oh. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.This is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?Two things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest. With 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all.",

        "text": "This film from Quentin Tarantino tells the intertwining stories of a couple of gangsters, their boss's wife, Mia, and a boxer who is meant to throw a fight. There is little in the way of plot; we just observe their lives for a few days. The two gangsters are Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield and they work for Marsellus Wallace; early on Vincent and Jules discuss an incident where Marsellus threw another man out of a fourth floor window for allegedly giving his wife a foot massage something that makes Vincent nervous as Marsellus has asked him to take Mia out for the night while he is out of town. The evening goes well until they get back to Mia's house and she overdoses on Vincent's heroin while he is in the bathroom. The second story follows Butch the boxer who rather than throwing a fight for Marsellus beats his opponent to death. He knows he has to get out of town but first he must return home to retrieve his watch that has been in the family for generation. This puts him in a dangerous place when he bumps into Marsellus. Finally we see events that took place earlier after Vincent accidentally shoots somebody in a car and he and Jules have to get some help from 'The Wolf'.As I said earlier this isn't about plot; that isn't to say nothing happens though quite the opposite. There is a decent amount of action; some of it sudden and shocking as well as great characters. It is these characters that the film is really about. The cast does a fine job; most notably John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson who are on top form as Vincent and Jules; Uma Thurman is also impressive as Mia Wallace as is Ving Rhames as her husband. Bruce Willis does a fine job as Butch and Harvey Keitel puts in a memorable performance as 'The Wolf'. The non-linear way the story is told isn't confusing; I rather liked how the opening and ending scenes were concerned with the same event and chronologically took place in the middle of the story. Quentin Tarantino's dialogue is realistic but cool; I liked how the characters talked about mundane things; it made them feel far more real than if they had only talked about things relevant to the plot as characters in most films do. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film; it is gripping, full of great characters and dialogue and contains many unforgettable scenes it does however contain material that will offend many people; most notably a lot of swearing and liberal use of 'The N-Word' as well as some shocking moments.",

        "text": "Have you read my IMDb review of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs? The one where I say that, although the film is far from what I would class as original, the director unashamedly plundering the annals of obscure/cult/foreign cinema, the manner in which it is presented makes it a marvellous work of art in its own right?Same thing applies here. Only more-so.Pulp Fiction is an exquisite patchwork-quilt of a movie, stitched together from ideas, elements and scenes gathered together by Tarantino during his formative years as a movie-obsessed video store clerk. Assembled with an unerring eye for detail and the vision of a true artist, the film is a marvel to behold—over two and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance which proves just as captivating for me now as when I first clapped eyes on it almost two decades ago.Bold and bloody, with stunning performances from a wonderful ensemble cast, a flawless soundtrack, witty (and highly quotable) dialogue, and even a character called Brett, this impeccable slice of gritty neo-noir is fully deserving of top marks. 10/10.",

        "text": "Quentin Tarantino co-wrote, directed and co-stars in this flamboyant, literate, byzantine drama which is structured like a dime-store novel. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are Los Angeles hit-men, Uma Thurman is a gangster's girl whom Travolta is asked to entertain, Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run after one of his fights ended in death. Critically-acclaimed picture caught fire with audiences as well, resulting in more show-biz success stories than any other film of the 1990's. Is it really that good? Yes, the verbal interplay and canny, cheeky handling is quite often exhilarating, and the performances by Travolta, Jackson and Willis (and Harvey Keitel as a low-keyed Mob kingpin) are near-perfection; however, the film's mixture of queasy, bloody violence (undermined by the jokey tone) and the barrage of foul-mouthed, low-life characters can easily become wearing. It won't be to everyone's taste, surely, but it's a visceral, gripping cinematic experience nevertheless, one with a knockout soundtrack and an Oscar-winning screenplay. *** from ****",

        "text": "Read the external reviews, like Ebert's or Barardinellis', if you want to know more about \"content\" of Pulp Fiction. Following is my personal take on the film.Many have praised this film for \"interweaving 3 different stories.\" Ever watch the TV series \"Northern Exposure?\" Every episode consists of 3 different, interwoven stories, and done much better than Tarentino does here. What this film does well is poke fun at the gangster movies, and does it with very witty writing. I especially liked the way these sordid characters got into various \"philosophical discussions\", like why in France a quarter-pounder cannot be called that, because of the metric system. Or why Jackson's character would not eat pork, because it is a dirty animal.To really enjoy this film, you have to numb yourself to all the filthy language and the gratuitous violence. However, it is neither an innovative film nor one with lasting meaning. That is why I rate it 5 of 10, and only that high because of the clever screenplay and direction.That reflects my own preference in movies. I give my highest ratings to such films as \"Longitude\", \"Nixon\", \"Apollo Thirteen\", \"Amistad\" - films based on great true stories. Or just entertaining but inoffensive ones like \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"The Matrix\". Or thought-provoking ones such as \"Shawshank Redemption\", \"American History X\", \"Lone Star\", or \"Good Will Hunting\".I give low ratings to such films as \"The Game\", \"The Usual Suspects\" - films which on the surface seem to dazzle, but in final analysis simply try to fool us into thinking they are something special. I don't think \"Pulp Fiction\" exactly does this, but its fans have given it high praise that I'd bet even its creator would hesitate to do.",

        "text": "There are movies and then there are forces of pop culture nature. Pulp Fiction is just such a film. While so much before influenced it, nothing after would ever be the same. In its wake, so many films tried to xerox its non-linear narrative, ultraviolence and wildly veering plot points. Pretty much not a single one of them is halfway decent by comparison.Tarantino took some scenes that Roger Avery intended for True Romance and decided that none of the film would appear in true order. For many, it was the first film they had ever watched that had monologues and conversations that were at the same time about everything and nothing all at once. While TriStar Pictures turned down the film, it became the first movie that Miramax would fully finance.Why would TriStar not want to make this film, particularly after Tarantino had become so big after Reservoir Dogs? Roger Avary said that the studio had issues with nearly every part of the movie, as they basically said, \"This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent and unfilmable.\"I wonder how the person that said that felt after Pulp Fiction was voted as the winner of the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for seven Oscars. Obviously, this film was also a commercial success, remaking the career of John Travolta and causing people to take notice of the acting skills of Uma Thurman and Samuel Jackson.There's a moment in this film that determines whether or not you like and understand Tarantino. Before they enter Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia Wallace (Thurman) asks if Vincent Vega (Travolta) is square and she illustrates that point with her fingers. Suddenly, the movie becomes animated and dashed lines illustrate her point and realism fades away. In this small moment, you either think that this is the dumbest thing you've ever seen, totally pretentious or completely and utterly awesome. I fall into the latter category and began cheering the moment it happened on screen.Pulp Fiction begins with a diner being held up by Ringo (Tim Roth, who was in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer, So I Married an Axe Murderer) before we move into Jules Winnfield (Jackson) and Vega (Travolta, in a role originally intended for Michael Madsen, who had played the other Vega brother, Mr. Blonde, in Reservoir Dogs) taking a briefcase back for their boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames, Con Air), after a long discussion of what McDonald's calls their food in Europe.What's in that briefcase? All that we learn is that the lock for it is 666, but it's a MacGuffin - a term invented by English screenwriter Angus MacPhail and popularized by Alfred Hitchcock. The case was originally going to have diamonds in it, but that's kind of boring. Instead, it opens to have a strange glow. Tarantino has been very coy about what it really is, even doing an interview with his friend Robert Rodriguez where they cut out the real answer before his fellow Grindhouse director says that the knowledge of what is really in the case radically changed how he saw the film.There are plenty of theories of what's really in that case. If we extrapolate that Tarantino was influenced by Kiss Me Deadly, then it's a nuclear device. It's been compared to the trunk in Repo Man. And an internet rumor began that it's really Marcellus Wallace's soul as evidenced by the band-aid on the back of his neck which is supposedly where the Egyptians believed the soul resided.The two bring the briefcase to their boss, Marsellus, but first, he bribes Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to do the job in his next match. Then, the boss goes out of town but asks Vega to show his wife a nice time. How nice of a time? After all, he threw a man out a window just for giving her a foot massage.About feet - this is the movie where Tarantino reveals his foot fetish. I'm not being rude or sly; it's 100% obvious upon watching the film.Before the date, Vega buys heroin from Lance (Eric Stoltz), who is out of balloons, so he puts it in a baggie. This will be important after the date of dinner and dancing at the aforementioned 1950's pop culture diner Jack Rabbit Slim's. Their dance scene here - taken almost move from move from Fellini's 8 1/2 scene where Barbara Steele dances with Mario Pisu - is more than just a simple physical scene. For a moment in time, it freezes reality and makes us think back to why we love Travolta the actor and not just Vincent the character that he is portraying. When we see him, we don't just see every role that he has ever played. We are fixated on the role that we first fell in love with, Tony Manero from Saturday Night Fever, bringing back fond thoughts of what it was like when to see the actor on the dance floor.Vega is obviously enamored of Mia and feels that things could feel the same with her, so he plans on simply leaving. However, she snorts the heroin - thinking it's coke - and nearly dies. It takes a needle of adrenaline right to her heart to fix things, as much as they can be fixed.While all this is going on, Butch wins the fight and kills his opponent. As he escapes in a taxi, its driver (Pittsburgh native Angela Jones, who graduated from the same college that I did, Point Park, and would go on to play the same character in the film Curdled, as well as date Slash) asks him what it's like to kill a man.Butch has told his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros, who was Anais Nin in Henry and June) to get everything ready to run away, but she forgot his gold watch, which we learn his father smuggled in a very uncomfortable place, along with Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who tells him the story of the watch in a flashback. Butch must go back home, where he encounters Vega reading Modesty Blaise on the toilet. One barrage of bullets later and he's on the run, but when Marcellus Wallace crosses his path, he decides to hit him with his car.Both injured, Marcellus begins shooting at Butch, who runs into a pawnshop. Maynard (Duane Whitaker, one of the racist cops in Tales From the Hood), the owner, ends up taking both by gunpoint and ties them up in a room where his partner Zed (Peter Greene, who was in The Mask) takes Marcellus from behind while the gimp (Stephen Hibbert, who was married to Julia Sweeney at the time, who also shows up briefly as the daughter of Monster Joe; Joe was going to be played by Dick Miller, but that scene was cut) watches over Butch.Butch overpowers the man in the bondage suit and decided to go back and save his enemy, using a sword to kill Maynard while Marcellus grabs a shotgun and shoots Zed, wounding him just enough so that he can call some of his worst men to get revenge. They agree that Butch can leave, but can never come back to Los Angeles. He grabs Zed's bike, gets his girl - who really has caused so much of this mess because she acts like a child - and gets out of town.Why does Butch save the man who made his life hell? Because in Tarantino's mashup universe, protagonists live in the symbolic universe of the Japanese samurai, where honor is more important than anything. Leaving Marcellus to have his manhood further destroyed and then killed isn't the death that a warrior deserves. It's no accident that of the weapons offered, which also include a hammer, a chainsaw and a bat, he takes the sword.Back in time, as they get the briefcase, Jules and Vincent surviving an attack at Brett's apartment when a man somehow misses them every single time. They argue over whether this was a miracle or not, which leads to Vincent accidentally shooting Marvin (Phil LaMarr, the voice of Green Lantern John Stewart on the Justice League cartoons). They decide to visit Jules' friend Jimmie (Tarantino), who is stressed about his wife coming home from work. That means that the cleaner, Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel), must come and do his work by disposing of the evidence.That issue dealt with, the dup come back to the diner at the beginning of the film. Jules decides that he's going to retire and walk the earth like Kane from Kung Fu, which Vincent finds ridiculous. As he goes to the bathroom, the couple we met earlier start to rob the place. Vincent returns and this leads to a Mexican standoff, but Jules successfully uses his newfound love of peace to diffuse the situation and everyone leaves alive.The Bible passage that Jules quotes isn't exactly from the Good Book. It's more paraphrased and also harkens back to the lessons that Sonny Chiba would deliver before vanquishing evil in his films.Pulp Fiction got its start as a trilogy that would be written by Avery and Tarantino, but would also have a third director. It was inspired by Mario Bava's Black Sabbath, which is another portmanteau film. Tarantino's original story, Black Mask, ended up becoming Reservoir Dogs. Avery's story Pandemonium Reigns is the gold watch story within this film.There's no score to the film, but instead a pastiche of near underground American music. There's a ton of surf rock in this film, as Tarantino felt that it sounded like the themes of Italian spaghetti westerns.This is also the beginning of the incredibly self-referential universe of Tarantino films. Vincent Vega and Mr. Blonde being brothers, Red Apple cigarettes and Big Kahuna burgers show up in many of his films and Mia Wallace's TV pilot Fox Force Five is either a tease for Kill Bill or places that film as a fictionalized part of an overall narrative. For kids that grew up reading comic books or loving when TV shows crossed over, this would become an entirely new obsession. Throw in the fact that this movie references every movie that came before it and you get the reason why we're devoting an entire week to these films.Pulp Fiction is 25 years old this year. It doesn't feel that way. It achieves that rarest of movie dreams - utter timelessness.",

        "text": "Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you.",

        "text": "Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. This movie is a crime film directed by Quentin Tarantino, who co-wrote its screenplay with Roger Avary. The film is known for its rich, eclectic dialogue, ironic mix of humor and violence, nonlinear storyline, and host of cinematic allusions and pop culture references.It stars the following namely: John Travolta,Samuel L. Jackson,Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel,Tim Roth,Amanda Plummer,Maria de Medeiros,Ving Rhames,Eric Stoltz,Rosanna Arquette,Christopher Walken and Bruce Willis. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.This film is a spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture.It could be considered the best film of the year it was released - 1994 - and of this decade in the 1990's.Also,it is a triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color.Obviously,this film is violent, profane and filled with addicts, racists and killers. At the same time, it may be one of the most moral stories the big screen has seen in years.Also,it was brilliantly written and unfathomably cool, this would make a good case for most quotable crime movie of all time.In summary,this is one great movie that is gives great entertainment as well as a stylish and foxy comedy of errors.",

        "text": "It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10",

        "text": "PULP FICTION is the sort of tale right up Quentin Tarantino's dark alley of a fictional mind. All of his criminals speak the profanity-laced dialog with such effortless ease that it seems perfectly natural after the first five minutes to hear the \"f\" word and the \"n\" word spoken with regularity by a very competent cast of actors. There is no such thing as political correctness in his vocabulary, so it's an audacious piece of work.Tarantino weaves the tales of several characters, not all of whom are related, until eventually the tales do dovetail together to make a common pattern out of the jumbled narrative. It's all done in brisk, good story-telling style to keep the viewer interested throughout the two-and-a-half hour running time.The dark humor is present in almost every situation you can think of involving murder and mayhem and somewhere, in all the Bible readings that SAMUEL L. JACKSON quotes, there's a message about redemption that seems to be the raison d'etre for the final scene in the diner.UMA THURMAN has delicious fun with the role of a gangster's moll who sniffs a little too much white powder in the ladies room while on a date with JOHN TRAVOLTA. The two of them get a chance to demonstrate their prowess with romantic comedy in this wonderful sequence where they go to a '50s-theme restaurant with an art deco ambiance and some '50 icons like Marilyn Monroe, Ed Sullivan and Mamie Van Doren doing their stuff while platters are served. They also indulge in a twist dance contest which, naturally, they win.It's the lightest moment in a film with plenty of dark twists and unpredictable shoot-outs that are a blend of violent gore and gales of laughter. HARVEY KEITEL has a fine time with the role of a \"cleaner-upper\" who gives instructions on how to wipe the blood off messy crime scenes. BRUCE WILLIS is excellent as a boxer who fails to lose the match and has to go on the lam to escape the wrath of a crime boss. His brutal treatment at the hands of a sadistic hardware store owner and his sick pals is one of the most lurid episodes of the many layered story. They don't call this \"pulp fiction\" for nothing!! Despite the disturbing scenes of violence, it manages to be a highly entertaining mix of crime and comedy that keeps rolling along toward a satisfying ending in the diner where the first scene involving TIM ROTH and AMANDA PLUMMER took place.Summing up: More likely to have broadest appeal for young male viewers who like their crime stories raw, real and unpredictable. Original, inventive and understandably awarded a great many honors when released.",

        "text": "Writer and director Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" qualified as a revelation when it came out in 1994, and time has not diminished the impact of this landmark film. This crime melodrama about a pair of philosophical hit men, a treacherous boxer, a cocaine-snorting drug dealer's wife, and a cleaner shifts back and forth between tragic drama and helium comedy with irony galore. If Tarantino had not made any other movie, he would still have been assured a niche in cinematic history with \"Pulp Fiction.\" He juggles four complicated plot lines about an eccentric gallery of characters who are all low-lives in one way of another living on the fringe of society, whether they be murderers, thieves, narcotics dealers, sexual perverts, or small-time, pistol-wielding crooks. \"Pulp Fiction\" defies chronological time because Tarantino stages everything out of order. This fractured form of storytelling might alienate those spectators accustomed to chronological order. Not one minute of this marathon two hour and forty-five minute audacity is dull. Ultimately, Tarantino and co-scenarist Roger Avary received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, while the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Tarantino for Best Director, the film itself for Best Picture, John Travolta for Best Actor, Sally Menke for Best Editing, and Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman respectively for Best Supporting Male and Female roles. Over ten years later \"Pulp Fiction\" is still outstanding, largely because it is such a timeless tale of amoral mayhem. Tarantino's quotable dialogue, his articulate underworld thugs, and his archly sardonic take on life retains its vivacity. Inspite of the scrambled up stories, Tarantino plots everything very carefully, foreshadowing situations and predicaments, with characters facing the consequences of their actions. Tarantino inspired a generation of movie makers, but none of them have come close to eclipsing his masterpiece.\"Pulp Fiction\" opens in a restaurant with Ringo/Pumpkin (Tim Roth of \"Reservoir Dogs\") discussing the various problems involved in the art of robbery with his girlfriend Yolanda/Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer of \"The Prophecy\")and their impulsive decision to rob the restaurant. Colorful credits follow and Tarantino introduces us to Jules (Samuel L. Jackson of \"Shaft\") and Vincent (John Travolta of \"Saturday Night Fever\") as Vincent talks about the difference between what hamburgers are called in Amsterdam. A quarter-pounder is called a Royale with cheese and most food is referred to using the metric system. They arrive at an apartment where they are supposed to pick up an attachÃ© case from four twentysomething guys as a part of a deal that went south. Jules questions Brett (Frank Whaley of \"The Doors\") about the guy's questionable business practices with Jules' boss Marsellus Wallace. All the dumbfounded Brett can utter after he witnesses Jules shoot one of his friends on a sofa in cold blood is the word \"What?\" Jules warns him not to say \"what\" again. Nevertheless, Brett says \"What\" five times and Jules puts a bullet in his shoulder. Vincent and Jules retrieve the mysterious suitcase, but not before another guy bursts from the bathroom with a \"cannon\" like revolver and fires indiscriminately at them. The guy misses each time and Jules and Vincent blow him away and leave with the case and another bystander, Marvin (Phil LaMarr of \"Old Dogs\") after they kill Brett.",

Pulp Fiction has the film noir elements - the gritty crime-drama, the clever, solid plot, the hard-edged characters. Yet is has even more: great humour, incredibly snappy and clever dialogue, the coolest, swaggering characters and clever little sub- plots. Add in the time-jump element which adds to the intrigue and originality and you have the greatest movie ever made.",

I had no idea Steve Buscemi was in the movie. He had a tiny tiny role as the Buddy Holiday server at the restaurant. Only because I've seen him in so much since then was I able to recognize him in Pulp Fiction. 2.) Samuel L. Jackson was a riot! He was chock full of funny lines and zingers, and even the way he delivered them... priceless.If you haven't seen Pulp Fiction before then it may be a little confusing the first time you watch. I know I was confused. The main characters stay the same throughout the movie but Tarantino jumbles their little individual stories so that the order of the movie isn't chronological. It is no real hindrance to watching the movie it just makes you pay attention more.The movie is good as the IMDb rating will tell you. For my money, the Samuel Jackson scenes were all I needed.",

        "text": "Quentin Tarantino had done it again. If you thought he would just be an one day fly after \"Reservoir Dogs\", you couldn't be more wrong.Once again just like in \"Reservoir Dogs\" the storytelling is unique. The movie has several different story lines that are all in some way connected and to make the story even more complicated, they are not told in the right order. It sound like the story is hard to follow, how ever this is not the case. The story is easy to follow, so everybody should be able to see the brilliance of it.The movie is filled with sex, drugs, violence and bad language. All of this combined makes the movie one of the most kick butt movies.All of the stories are great and wonderfully written. It's amazing to see how they are connected. The stories are not typically Hollywood like, meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules. What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues. The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to, they are very raw and realistic, just like the characters. Brilliant dialogue!There are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history.The movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood.There is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Phil LaMarr, Frank Whaley, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken. Having such a cast is already a signal that this is more than just an ordinary movieA must see unique movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

        "text": "This is probably the hardest movie for me to rate and review; how do you review a film where about half of it is great, and the rest(which pretty much means the other half) is awful? I decided to rate it a 5, since that seems to be the sensible thing to do in this situation. Like a few others have said, Tarantino's style is hip and makes you, the audience, feel hip. The dialog, the editing, the violence... the problem is, it's empty. The dialog is entirely superficial, which is OK if there's not too much of it or what there is there to be superficial. But here it carries half of the scenes. The dialog scenes(as pretty much everything else in the film) is very dull, visually. The camera doesn't move and rarely changes angle, and it's something that'll make you fall asleep, if the pointless, shallow dialogs don't do so first. The editing is daft as well. The violence is so over the top that you almost have to be mentally disturbed not to be affected(read: repulsed) by it... is that why it's there? Does Tarantino want to gross out his audience? Is that what it's about? The length and pace is horrible. I don't believe I've ever managed to sit through the entire thing attentively. The problem is not the length itself as much as what appears to be Tarantino yelling at his audience \"You want to see my movie? Well, you better prepare to sit there for what feels like 10 hours straight!\" Just to ensure that there are no misunderstandings; that was a metaphor. Tarantino doesn't *actually* yell at the audience. It just feels like it. The whole film feels like it's trying to get somewhere, to say something, but then the film is over, and it forgot to tell us what it was. The film is anticlimactic throughout(quite an achievement... usually only the end of a film is anticlimactic), and when it's done, you'll be saying to yourself \"That's it? What the heck was all that hype about?\" The truth is, in my opinion, a small group of Tarantino fans got together, and started 'converting' anyone they could find to love the film, and suddenly, this had taken over the general opinion on the film. Everybody thinks it's great, but no one can really explain why. I have yet to meet someone who've explained why Tarantino's films supposedly are great. Now don't get me wrong; I don't have anything against the guy. I like several of his films; Jackie Brown, From Dusk 'Till Dawn and Kill Bill 1&2. The problem here is that the film lacks any real substance. None of the characters are likable, not even slightly. They are killers, drug-dealers, psychos and morons. The film has the typical non-linear time-line which Tarantino utilizes in virtually all of his films. However, here it seems redundant, like it was just tagged on for no actual reason. Both volumes of Kill Bill were great because of good use of this; Pulp Fiction is not, because of the use of aforementioned effect is seemingly pointless here. The actors all play exactly the same type of character that they always play, with one or two possible exceptions. Samuel Jackson plays the 'violent, loud-mouthed individual with an unusual belief or philosophy' what do you know, that came right off his trademark section of his biography on this very site. John Travolta is the usual cool guy. Ving Rhames is the typical tough black guy, same as always. Do I need to go on? If you've read everything up to this point, you might think I hate this movie... I don't. I just dislike half of it. And that's just the thing... I can't entirely hate this. The scenes with Travolta and Jackson are pretty good, a few of the lines in the film are quotable, and most of the characters are well-cast. There you have it; half bad, half good. Better than Reservoir Dogs, but not as good as Jackie Brown and not even in the same league as the two Kill Bill films. I recommend this only to Tarantino junkies. Everyone should stay away, unless they are crazy about one or more actors in the film. If you do see it, only see it once and try to pay attention(even though it's really hard). 5/10",

Though the movie payed homage to a variety of film genres and styles (film noir, gangster film, French New Wave), it managed to be unlike anything seen before. Whether you love \"Pulp Fiction\" or hate it (and I, for one, love it) you can't deny the impact it had on film-making moving forward into the 21st Century. While watching \"Pulp Fiction\" for the first time, I knew sitting there in the theatre that I was seeing something that would immediately influence movies forever, and it has. I won't bother to summarize the plot, since plot in this movie is only of incidental importance anyway. I won't bother to single out individual performances, since the performances are uniformly excellent. I will save my praise for Quentin Tarantino's audacious attempts to show us something original, daring and experimental and for giving us a welcome break from the stale products Hollywood studios have been churning out for years. If you're one of the handful of people in the world who haven't yet seen this film, run out and see it now. I can't guarantee you'll like it, but I can guarantee that you'll have a definite opinion about it, and even that is refreshing these days.Grade: A",

And Tarantino's faults - which become more apparent with every (pretentiously) numbered subsequent movie - are all here on show.His dialogue is good - it's his main strength, and is correctly recognised as such. But a) it is over-reliant on the F-word (his CSI episodes and Inglourious Basterds show that he can write excellent dialogue without it), and b) it would greatly benefit from external editing: Tarantino badly needs a McCartney to sweeten his Lennon, a Lennon to apply an edge to his McCartney.His direction is good - he extracts brilliant performances from his ensemble, and his ability to present a truly eye-catching image on screen is beyond doubt. Action is good, effects are good, set design is good etc.But he comes in for undue praise for other things. Self-indulgence is one - again, he desperately needs someone to take him in hand and moderate some of what he does for the benefit of the film.Case in point - Pulp Fiction's non-linear storytelling. The zip-rewind halfway through is not some sudden work of genius. It may very well be experimental but, if so, it does not work as well as linear storytelling would have done (which, I suspect, would have involved more work in breaking the story threads into coherent sections which still worked together when interleaved, or else inserting flashbacks). Tarantino has taken an unconventional, but easy, road and, in so doing, has got away with it because of the \"Emperor's New Clothes\" factor. However, it doesn't make Pulp Fiction a work of genius, it actually makes it a worse film.Tarantino's lack of self-discipline means that, despite his abundance of talent, his output continues to be over-rated.",

It's just not my cup of tea: excessive language, excessive violence, cheesy dialogue, strange visuals, and a story that's meant to be a throwback to old pulp fiction novels of the 1950s. If that is your cup of tea, you might love it!Famous for John Travolta's comeback, Uma Thurman's dancing, and Samuel L. Jackson's monologue about his favorite Bible passage, it's a tongue-in-cheek action drama about two hitmen, one of which falls for their boss's wife. There's quite a bit more to the story to that, so don't throw anything at me for condensing it as such, but it's told so out of order, and the movie is so long, it was practically impossible for me to understand anything more than that. At nearly three hours, even though I watched the censored version on television, I didn't get much more out of the movie than a ton of violence and some terrible wigs. I don't know why the dance scene became so famous; to me it looked incredibly stupid. Again, don't throw anything at me, but I obviously didn't get the point.If you do want to give it a shot, you'll see a huge supporting cast of Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, and Amanda Plummer. This is a highly acclaimed classic from the 1990s, but if you don't like it or don't even get all the way through it, you're not the only one.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel: Exhilarating masterpiece taking a comic book approach to its themes as if addressing a surreal reality. Screenplay divides into three stories. The first one introduces John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as hit men sent to retrieve a briefcase. Then Travolta is instructed to take the boss's wife out where an evening at the Jack Rabbit Slim ends with an overdose and a dripping needle held high for revival. Story two regards a boxer who double crosses his boss and flees with money, but when his wife forgot a valuable watch back at the apartment, he makes a dangerous venture into unexpected turmoil. Story three involves dispatching a corpse within limited time. Brilliantly crafted by Quentin Tarantino who previously made Reservoir Dogs, but here he creates an original masterpiece. Flawless acting by Travolta as a hit-man often caught in bad situations. Jackson as his partner is more reserved and careful. Bruce Willis delivers perhaps his greatest performance as a boxer bent on survival when a flashback involving a watch indicates its importance. Uma Thurman plays the drug addicted boss's wife with a mysterious past. Harvey Keitel plays a cleanup guy called upon when a body ends up in a trunk. Tense portrayal of violent lifestyles and the consequences. Score: 9 / 10",

Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).The lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90's films and beyond.I put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with 'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let 'em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film's worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it's a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God's grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn't and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.Both Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can't go wrong with \"Pulp Fiction.\" It's top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.THE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area.

        "text": "The modern-day movie public seems entranced with the in-your-face barbaric and crude film style of Quentin Tarantino. The writer-producer-actor definitely has talent, and an imagination. But films such as this that have long-running dialogs - some sensible but mostly far-fetched, need to have a solid plot to be interesting. The plot of \"Pulp Fiction\" is very weak - almost pointless. And when the long stretches of cinematic street philosophy are punctuated with brutal scenes of blood and guts, I don't find much of anything entertaining.I enjoy great mysteries, including some of the better film noir. But for the gore and guts movies to be good and have appeal, they must at least have an interesting plot and very good screenplay. \"Reservoir Dogs\" was such a Tarantino movie. But this plot has scenarios that bounce around in a weak screenplay. While there's a thin thread that connects some parts, others don't mesh. So, it comes across as a few short stories put together, some of which have the same characters.An example of this is when Christopher Walken's Captain Koons tells a tall story to a young boy named Butch Coolidge. Two scenarios or so later, Butch is a full-grown boxer played by Bruce Willis. Other scenarios happen out of order, or in reverse order. This seems to be a style with Tarantino, and one that some movie critics and buffs think is a great talent. I think it's a technique meant to grab an audience where the writer can't figure out a way to do it with a straight story chronologically.This sort of sets on end the long-standing teaching and methods of storytelling, writing, and playwrighting. And, there are a number of people who still prefer the chronological order of stories. We don't mind the use of flashbacks which are clearly identified as such. But wide changes in time or order, back and forth, from one scenario to another is confusing and says the author couldn't come up with the right ending. So, he or she used some weird techniques to make an ending superfluous. And, some of these films really don't have endings.This film could have started or ended just about anyplace within the screenplay. Tarantino or the director just needed to shuffle the pages. It ruins what might be a good story for me. As for the acting in this film - what's so outstanding about characters spewing vulgarities back and forth, or screaming and intimidating people with foul threats in running expletives? Seems we all have a tantrum streak within us.\"Pulp Fiction\" isn't an enjoyable or entertaining film. It is a look at the underworld of drugs, thugs, blood and guts. The only thing I can see that might attract such near adulation for this film is the huge and diverse cast. But I'll take any number of other types of films that can entertain with solid plots, screenplays with civility, and great acting.",

Even the violence is so over-the- top and in such bizarre situations that you can't help but laugh at how nonsensical it all is. This movie has grade-A dialogue (it's quotable beyond measure), the jumbled narrative works extremely well for the movie's unexpectedly connected stories, and it went a long way in defining the '90s (it certainly redefined Dick Dale's Misirlou). Not a bad movie, either.8/10",

        "text": "Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a work of postmodern art. It's unlike any film I've seen before, and because of that, I commend it for not searching for a blueprint or a formula to tell its story. Tarantino tells the story from pure originality, and like many of his future films, Pulp Fiction is told with a non-linear narrative making it hard to explain the plot. It's better to just introduce the characters and go from there.The story is about very different people whose lives intertwine with one another over the course of a few days. The characters first introduced are Pumpkin (Roth) and \"Honey Bunny\" (Plummer) who are talking in a dinner with plans to conduct a heist. We then cut to two detectives named Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Jackson) who are trying to retrieve a briefcase they can bring to their boss Marsellus Wallace (Rhames).Wallace has his own chapter in the film as well. Him and prizefighter Butch Coolidge (Willis) strike a deal where Butch accepts a large amount of money to throw an upcoming fight. While Wallace is tied up in this deal, Vega goes over to meet and take to dinner the lovely Mrs. Mia Wallace (Thurman). A series of events happen, causing dismay among Vega which lead to some very well-written and well-acted sequences.Being that the film is conducted in a very nontraditional style, Pulp Fiction is a task to follow sometimes. My advice; watch it and just go along with it. If you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead, or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too. Viewing multiple clips for a second time, I think I finally understand it more, but a lot of questions you'll still be asking after repeated viewings.One of the most famous questions is \"what's in the briefcase?\" that is recovered by Vega and Winnfield in the early scenes of the film. I'm sure when writing the film Tarantino himself didn't know what he wanted to put in the briefcase. I'm also sure he didn't think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth.What truly makes Pulp Fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog. Tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan. One moment the two are discussing why a Quarter Pounder With Cheese from McDonalds is called a \"Royale With Cheese\" in France. Next, they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question \"what?\" again.Why do I not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films, but for some reason award a perfect score to a film that is made up of it? Because Pulp Fiction shows how it should be done. It depicts realistic situations, handled intelligently and with wit and soul. It doesn't utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary, but to advance an already crafty storyline. The character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words. Is it necessary? Not really. But Pulp Fiction isn't just about swearing. It proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade.Starring: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Maria de Medeiros, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis, and Quentin Tarantino.

Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure.

        "text": "Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. Like all great directors, Q.T. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. A lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but \"Pulp Fiction\" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. And not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. It's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time.A lesser director than Tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. Instead, Tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: He actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. Most critics interpret this as Quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. They're wrong. The dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. The difference is that dialogue in a movie such as \"The Presidio\" isn't real at all. The characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (\"rinse, spit, repeat\"). Quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. No doubt Jules and Vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. One must keep in mind that we actually hear little about Jules and Vincent, and even less talk between them. But when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. And this is what so many people miss when viewing \"Pulp Fiction\" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. Quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the French translate the term \"Quarter Pounder with Cheese\" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: Quentin later uses this same reference for Jules before he and Vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), one of the town's major kingpins.\nThere are essentially three stories in \"Pulp Fiction,\" intertwined between one another. It opens with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her boyfriend (Tim Roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. By their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them \"with their pants down\"? The stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following Jules and Vincent, who work for Marsellus, who has paid championship boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to fall in his upcoming match. But Butch has a better plan: Bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. He almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with Marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in \"Deliverance.\"Back to the dialogue. It is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. It's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. For example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear Jules and Vincent discussing the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese? No. But our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if Tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. There are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends or family has a deeper meaning and will no doubt relate to the matter at hand. All dialogue relates to a larger scheme, and so does the dialogue in \"Pulp Fiction.\" It's just more casual and subtle than most movies. It's not pointless, but it's not deliberate, which is a fine line to try and balance on. Quentin does so successfully, crossing the finish line with enthusiasm, which is no doubt part of what elevates \"Pulp Fiction\" above so many other motion pictures of its genre.5/5.",

        "text": "While I have given some pretty long reviews to Clint Eastwood's Westerns--particularly the wonderful FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, I will only give a brief review of this movie because there are so many reviews already I doubt if my pontificating will actually influence many people. After all, this is widely seen as one of the greatest Westerns ever made and since I liked it immensely, there isn't much need to say more.Well, there are actually a few Westerns I liked a bit more--I am a HUGE fan of THE BIG COUNTRY. But, when it comes to style, originality and the epic proportions of this film, none can match it, though ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST comes very, very close. The acting and script are just fine and the music is intensely weird but effective. Of all the films I have seen with music by Ennio Morricone, this is his most intense and strangest. And it works perfectly in this film, but I also appreciate much of his more restrained work in other films and would never want all Westerns to have such distinctive and bizarre music as in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY--it would just lose its magic and might even tend to overwhelm the film.About the only negatives about this film are the title and it is a pretty violent film that the little ones probably shouldn't watch. There is a lot of blood and violence and you do get to see (yuck) Eli Wallach's butt. As for the title, sure, Lee Van Cleef was truly \"BAD\" and Eli Wallach was cure \"UGLY\", but Clint as \"the GOOD\"? Well, his character was far from good--but of course, who would like the title to be \"The Kinda Good, The Bad And the Ugly\"?! Not to be missed by any serious fan or the genre.",

The Good, The Bad and the Ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made. There may be nothing new about the story at first glance, but that's the point, Leone is paying homage to the Hollywood western, and despite the initial simplicity there is also a complexity mainly in the film's characters. Regardless of whether simple or complex it is, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly does have a compelling and brilliantly written story.But there are other assets that make The Good, The Bad and the Ugly so good. The dialogue is always excellent, while Leone's direction is superb once again. The characters are great and are superbly played. Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever here, and Eli Wallach is perfectly cast and more than a match for him. I was also very impressed with Lee Van Cleef, who I recognised from High Noon and such, but he makes a bigger impression here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is also the most violent of the trilogy, and one of the most violent of the genre, not a bad thing whatsoever.The pace was spot on too, even though the film is nearly three hours long, it is never boring or dull. The best things though about The Good, The Bad and the Ugly are the visuals and Ennio Morricone's score. The film looks amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous and the sweeping images and scenery are very lovingly crafted. Morricone's score is even more impressive than that, it is simply one of the best film scores I've ever heard, and if I had to say which was Morricone's best score, I would immediately say this.Overall, there is nothing bad or ugly about the film. The film is amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

        "text": "Bearing in mind that I think westerns are an American art form and I have an aversion to the European made ones, Sergio Leone's The Good The Bad And The Ugly has a lot to recommend it. Not the least of which the impact it had on Clint Eastwood's career making him an American icon.The Good The Bad And The Ugly follows an odyssey of three men, two of them a pair of lowlifes and the third no better than he ought to be in a search for buried gold. It's quite the odyssey that Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef in those title roles have in search of the loot. A minor theater of the Civil War is operating in the west and all of them get caught up in it as well.Clint Eastwood developed and honed his laconic and cynical character who was in fact a good guy. Which gives you some idea of the bad guys he faced in his western films. Note that Clint Eastwood also never returned to the spaghetti western after this film.Van Cleef is his usual mean self, perhaps exponentially so. One thing about him is that he's a hired killer with a strong work ethic so I guess that counts for something. When he takes a contract he follows through. As for Wallach he dusts off his Mexican bandit characterization that served him so well in The Magnificent Seven is dusted off and embellished. At one point he's got Eastwood at his sadistic mercy, but when he learns of the loot, Wallach's greed gets the better of him.I don't consider this the great classic that many do, but The Good The Bad And The Ugly will satisfy most western fans.",

        "text": "Leone's conclusion to his DOLLARS trilogy once again shows how he had progressed as a director from the previous two films - with his style now evident and developed, his pacing slowed down to a gentle speed and exactly the right combination of editing, photography, and art direction, Leone was ready to make what many consider to be his greatest film - ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Unfortunately, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is sometimes overlooked in place of that film, and although it's only the third of a trilogy, the film still has an epic feel to it.This film's main benefit over the previous two is Ennio Morricone's score. While his music was very good in A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, here it becomes the stuff of legend and one of most recognised western tunes ever written; it's also by and far Morricone's best ever work, to this day. Leone retains the solid Eastwood from the previous two films and also brings back Lee Van Cleef, this time playing a bad guy (unfortunately - I prefer his heroes to his villains as I like the guy). Most screen time, though, is given to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN's Eli Wallach, who is also excellent as the wanted criminal Tuco, a man who lives by his wits and courage and isn't afraid to take risks.Eastwood plays his role to perfection, as he should with so much practice. He gets to say some well-remembered lines such as \"There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend...\" Van Cleef is exceptionally evil and sadistic as the villain of the piece, my only complaint is that he has relatively little screen time in comparison to the other two main stars and thus feels slightly underused. Also appearing are some familiar faces like Luigi Pistilli and Rada Rassimov.The plot is a wider and more political one than before, as it shows how the Civil War intruded upon the quiet serenity of the Old West. The brief battle scenes we do see are sweeping and epic, up there with the best put on film. Leone's direction is stylish and a work of genius, and he serves up a number of odd, memorable situations. These include a shoot-out in a bombed town, complete with blackened smoking ruins; an ingenious way to remove handcuffs; and the blowing up of a bridge. The scene is also set for one of the best sequences in cinema; the confrontation between Wallach, Van Cleef, and Eastwood in the cemetery at the film's end. Here, the music, quick photography (close-ups of people's eyes, etc.) and acting combine to make this one of the coolest, most tense showdowns in history. One must not forget the element of comedy which Leone also uses to make the film lighter and more enjoyable; he succeeds well. Definitely one of the best spaghetti westerns out there.",

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY has become one of the most loved Spaghetti Westerns out there and it's easy to see why because it contains all the style and violence that the genre has become known for. It's also easy to see why this film gained so many negative reviews when it was originally released but I think it's safe to say that its reputation of a classic isn't going anywhere. As with the previous two installments, Leone does a masterful job with the style of thing and especially the ending, which is clearly one of the greatest ever filmed. It's really amazing to see what Leone was able to do with the budget he had and the fact that he constantly tried to top the previous film in the series is something mighty impressive. I think most directors would have been happy with A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS but Leone managed to build on that and then build on FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are all wonderful in their parts and there's no question that the three of them and their chemistry is now legendary. The violence in the film is often graphic but it's also very realistic and fitting for the subject matter. Then there's Ennio Morricone's score, which is so iconic yet it still sends shivers down your spine each time you hear it. The action scenes are excellently put together including the terrific battle on the bridge as well as some of the comedy relief early on dealing with hangings. If there's one problem with the film I think it runs on way too long for its own good. Yes, I know many love the epic feel of the picture but I still think it runs on way too long in its extended version.",

        "text": "\"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo\" or \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is an Italian co-production that is in the original also in the English language and was released back in 1966, so this one is over half a century old now already, which sadly means that almost all of the people working on it are (long) gone. But first things first. The director here is Sergio Leone and he is also one of many people working on the screenplay here. The movie runs for considerably over 2 hours and there are many versions out there, one of them even crossing the 3-hour mark. The cast includes many well-established actors and the big name by today's standards is of course Clint Eastwood who was in his mid-30s when this was made. Maybe Eli Wallach (who almost turned 100 before his death not too long ago) is also still known to many and maybe even Lee Van Cleef, who did not get as old as the other two. These three play the main characters in this movie we got here, the three mentioned in the title. And there is a nice introduction so we know who is who. And the ugly even gets another quick mention near the end, maybe because his one at the beginning was so short. Honestly we learn a lot more about the ugly in the introduction of the good than in his own introduction. Or maybe he gets the one at the end because in my opinion he was just the most memorable of the three and Eli Wallach also gave the best performance in the movie. Already how effortlessly he looked like a Hispanic was impressive because he really was a Jew. And he is also the one who kept this film from becoming too serious because his character always brought in some comedy value and even during these moments when Eastwood makes a short funny one-liner like along the lines of \"idiots they are talking to you\" Wallach is present and his body language adds a lot to the fun element. But people should not mistake Tuco for a fool. He may not be educated or a leader, but he makes up for it with grit determination and also ruthlessness. And there is also a soft side to him, he is not as cold-blooded as Sentenza, who would kill anybody if he had to. Tuco's soft side is especially brought out by his brother as we see during one scene and despite being a ruthless killer he believes in God and salvation it seems. He also mostly really only kills those who did something bad to him first, such as Eastwood's character, but also Sentenza's big henchman.Sentenza really has no mercy for anybody and he is also a schemer unlike Tuco. A really dangerous man, who still is a man of his word. When he makes a contract, he fulfills it. You could also call him talented when it comes to upping the ranks as you see when the two more central characters get caught in a funny sequence that involves a lot of dust. But like I said nobody here delivers the comedy as good as Tuco/Wallach. Even if he goes over the top, it is still hilarious to watch and never feels out of place. The best example is really the scene when he all of a sudden acts like a best friend to Blondie to find out the name of the grave where the treasure is hidden. By the way, I also liked at the very end that there was an actual treasure and not just some meaningful message à la \"the biggest treasure is friendship\" or so. There is none of that anyway. The three-men shootout shows it best. It is a matter of life and death. Honestly if the other two, especially Tuco, had been as smart as Blondie they could have guessed where the treasure really is. There must be a reason he knows the name and surely it is not that the name he mentions was a deceased friend or so. Also makes sense Blondie does not tell Tuco the real name, he is too smart for that, just like the empty name on the stone. Also pretty fitting that the treasure is in the grave of an unknown soldier in terms of the political message the movie sends. It takes place during the days of the Civil War and there is one lengthy sequence when Tuco and Blondie are led along by a captain and this is the one occasion during which the focus is not really on these two, but on the pointlesssness of war back then just like today. The bridge is the best example. They won't fight for it, but just go elsewhere and fight if it is gone. It's pretty deep and telling how the captain waits for the bridge to be destroyed and smiles before he passes. So yeah this was interesting because the sequence felt so different compared to the rest of the movie, but still it felt like an essential inclusion nonetheless.Basically I could really write a novel about every single scene here. Other people have said it correctly that each and every one of them adds a lot. Also the small characters are memorable like the fat henchman I already mentioned. Or the guy who lost a hand and wants his revenge on Tuco and probably half a dozen other characters who maybe would have deserved their own movie. But good that these three got it. Actually, in the German title there are only two characters mentioned and called something like crooks. I still prefer the three, even if Sentenza / Angel Eyes is not as much in the center as the other two. Now finally a few words on Blondie as a big Eastwood fan. He was coolness personified, but not an invincible superhero as you see from how he is tricked by Tuco during the spikes scene and even if he gets away there, Tuco gets him again, which shows you he knows how to get his revenge. During the lengthy desert scene he really suffers badly, but still most of the time he is nicely in control of it all. A really memorable character we got here, even if maybe how he is depicted with baby kittens was slightly too much. We get it he's the good guy, the only one really with morals and nonetheless as relentless and determined as the other two. That he cares at least a bit for other people is shown in the scene when he has too say goodbye to Shorty when he found another partner in crime for his bounty hunting scam. He was not as blond as I thought he was though that he deserved the nickname. I watched this movie as part of a retrospective on Ennio Morricone and it was a truly nice experience. It was not the first time I saw it and honestly it did not take away any of the quality, or almost none, that I basically knew the key plot points, even if it has been a long time since I saw it. So yeah I already mentioned Morricone, his soundtrack here is really as defining as it gets for the western genre which was also proved by the people dancing and moving in their seats in my showing every time the soundtrack was heard and so is the movie itself. No doubt most people consider this one of the five finest western movies ever made, if not the number one even. And I can see where they are coming from. Really almost everything works out about this one, also the sound side away from the music, be it the effects of running horses or gunfire you just really felt inside the movie. What did not work out was Wallach's and everybody else's glaring omission from awards bodies. Oh yeah also this is one of the westerns that has no female love interest for the protagonist(s). The woman you see in Bad's presentation for example is all you get. And that is perfectly fine and enough. I give it a big thumbs-up and it is a definite contender for best film of 1966. Highly recommended.",

Only Joe knows the name of the grave, therefore there is a great dispute between the two gunmen, but always keeping Joe alive. This is a really classic western movie. This movie has never been released on VHS in Brazil, and only now the distributor Fox do Brasil' released on DVD format. I am a great fan of Sergio Leone, and the first DVD I bought for my collection was 'Once Upon the Time in America'. 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is great in all aspects: the story is very funny, the actors have great performances, and the soundtrack from Enio Morricone is unforgettable: it is certainly one of the most beautiful and known in the cinema history. This movie is really a great entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Três Homens em Conflito\" (\"Three Men in Conflict\")",

        "text": "Two men have a partnership  one (the good) pretends to capture the other (the ugly) claiming the reward before rescuing him from his sentence.  When the two have a falling out they spare each other simply because they both know part of the location of hidden confederate gold.  Meanwhile a corrupt soldier is also hunting for the location of the gold or anyone who may know where it is.Routinely heralded as one of the greatest westerns ever made, I must admit to always feeling a little disappointed by this film whenever I watch it. However I always then assume that it is a classic and come back to watch it again!  There is no denying that the film is very stylish and very memorable but it's main problem is in it's basic plot not being long enough to justify such a luxurious running time.  This results in the film really dragging at several points  this is not a major problem but I did wonder why it could not have been edited to suit it's spaghetti style.The music and action is much imitated and well known to even those who have not yet seen the film.  The closing stand-off is fantastic and the music throughout can only be described as iconic.  The film does manage to cover 180 minutes well but I just had an issue with it's very wandering nature and the fact that it does drag a bit.The cast is all good.  Some of the support is badly dubbed but I always found that to add to the character of the film rather than be an annoyance. Eastwood had a hard time on the set but still delivers a really good performance  the type which made his name in this type of film.  Wallach has the biggest role as Ugly and is very good in an unsympathetic role.  Van Cleef is a good Bad and is a cool foil for Eastwood.Overall I always enjoy this film but would draw the line at putting it as high up the top 50 list as it usually appears to be.  The film is iconic in so many ways but I just don't like the way that it seems to drag at several points  it could easily benefit from losing 20 minutes.",

        "text": "I guess I find myself somewhat in the middle on this film, I enjoyed it to a point, but I don't get the sense that this is one of the greatest Westerns ever, and the Western is my favorite movie genre. I much prefer a good psychological Western between complex antagonists, Eastwood's own \"Unforgiven\" would be an example. This was more a straightforward tale of three desperadoes consumed by greed who attempt to outwit each other on the trail to an unknown grave containing two hundred thousand dollars in gold coin. Each though, earns their respective title credit in the story, even if Eastwood's Blondie might be the 'good' simply based on his classically rugged features.More on the plus side, it was really cool to hear the title theme music expressed in a handful of different ways throughout the story. The picture also captured the gritty realism of what the 1860's wild west was probably a lot like. You know, the more films I see of cowboys out in the desert days at a time with no access to soap and water, I start to wonder if they'll ever produce a picture that captures the fresh aroma of that experience. It's one thing to hear Tuco accused of smelling like a pig, but to actually get the full flavor of that would really be something. Then again, theater goers would never make it to the end of the picture - oh well for that idea.As for the film's length, I too side with those that feel it took a long time to get from Point A to Point B. I'm really wondering if it was necessary to bring in the Civil War battle for that bridge, but it did give rise to perhaps the most meaningful scene in the picture for me. Watching Blondie try to ease the soldier's death with his coat and a smoke was a masterful touch.You know, I could probably go so far as to put this film in the top twenty Westerns of all time, but it's position at #4 in the IMDb top rankings of ALL pictures (as I write this) is just too much of a stretch. That's probably the reason I find myself going to that page less and less, and watching movies of all types more and more.",

But it seemed flawed and people are quick to forgive here where they don't elsewhere.The historical accuracy of the film is the biggest problem, with guns that are incorrect for the period, and the really strange suggestion that the North fought the South in this region... which, really, just didn't happen. I liked the drunk military man, but it wasn't realistic.The dubbing was annoying. Clint Eastwood speaks English and he speaks to a variety of characters who are speaking Italian. Okay, one or the other. Hire actors who speak English or get Italians and subtitle the film. It's awkward to have Eastwood talking to people who, on the set, who probably didn't understand.Lastly, I need more Lee VanCleef. If he's \"the bad\", he should have a bigger role. Instead you have mostly Eastwood, who is \"the good\", being just as bad as the villain. I respect the idea that good and evil are not clear-cut, but why do I side with Eastwood if he's no more good than VanCleef? That being said, the film had a lot going for it. Very fun shooter, great bridge explosion scene (possibly better than \"River Kwai\") and the very memorable theme song. As far as Westerns go, I don't know that it was really much more advanced than \"Stagecoach\". Maybe more epic and longer, and Eastood can out-act John Wayne any day, but there wasn't much new here.I recommend this and feel I need to see it again, but perhaps see \"For a Few Dollars More\" first... that will give you some VanCleef action and Klaus Kinski.",

        "text": "I had not seen the \"Spaghetti\" Western Trilogy, directed by Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars, Once Upon a Time in the West, Once Upon a Time in America), for many years, and it made perfect sense to watch them again during the 90th birthday of the leading star. Basically, set during the American Civil War, a trio of bounty hunters attempt to kill fugitive Mexican bandit Tuco Ramírez, \"the Ugly\" (Eli Wallach). Tuco shoots the three bounty hunters and escapes on horseback. Elsewhere, mercenary Angel Eyes, \"the Bad\" (Lee Van Cleef) interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens (Antonio Casas), to find out about the new name of Jackson, a fugitive who has stolen and hidden bags of gold. Steven tells Angel Eyes that Jackson is using the new name Bill Carson. Stevens offers the bounty hunter $1,000 to kill Baker (Livio Lorenzon), his employer. Angel Eyes takes the money, but kills Stevens, fulfilling his contract. He then returns to Baker, collects his fee for killing Stevens, and then, shoots Baker. Meanwhile, Tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by a drifter, a \"Man with No Name\" to whom Tuco refers as \"Blondie\" (Clint Eastwood), who takes him to the local Sheriff (John Bartha) to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie sets Tuco fre, shooting the noose. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints and abandons him without horse or water in the desert. Tuco manages to walk to a village, and tracks Blondie down. He plans to force him to hang himself before Union forces distract him, and Blondie is able to escape. Tuco manages to recapture Blondie and forces to walk across the desert until he collapses from dehydration. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside are several dead Confederate soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson (Antonio Casale), who promises Tuco $200,000 in gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst before answering. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died, but Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that Carson told him the name on the grave before dying. Tuco is now motivated to keep Blondie alive, he gives him water and takes him to a nearby mission to recover. After Blondie's recovery, the two leave in Confederate uniforms from Carson's carriage, but Union soldiers capture them and take them to the prisoner of war camp of Batterville. Tuco answers to the name \"Bill Carson\" during roll call, gaining the attention of Angel Eyes, disguised as a Union sergeant. Angel Eyes tortures Tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only Blondie knows the name on the grave. Knowing he will not talk if tortured, Angel Eyes offer Blondie an equal share of the gold and a partnership. Blondie agrees and rides out with Angel Eyes and his gang. Tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes. Blondie, Angel Eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town; Tuco eventually makes his way to the same town. Tuco takes a bath, during which he is surprised by one of the earlier three bounty hunters, Elam (Al Mulock), but he manages to shoot him dead. Blondie investigates the gunshots and finds Tuco, they agree to resume their old partnership. The pair kill Angel Eyes's men, but Angel Eyes himself has escaped. Tuco and Blondie travel toward Sad Hill, but their way is blocked by a battle between Union troops and the Confederates. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies and allow them access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with explosives, Tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie says \"Arch Stanton\" is the name on the grave where the gold is buried. After the bridge explodes, the armies disperse. On their way, Blondie finds a dying soldier, but is unable to help him, he takes a poncho following the young man's death. Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself, but Blondie fires a cannon, causing him to fall, and fires further to intimidate him. Tuco eventually makes it to the cemetery and runs, passing the various graves, to find the named grave marker. He finds the name Arch Stanton and begins digging, and Blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. Moments later, Angel Eyes surprises them both. Blondie opens Stanton's grave, revealing only a skeleton, no gold. Blondie states that he lied and offers to write the real name of the grave on a rock, placing it face-down in the courtyard of the cemetery, challenging Tuco and Angel Eyes to a three-way duel. The trio stare each other down in a Mexican standoff. Everyone draws, and Blondie shoots and kills Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside Arch Stanton's, marked \"Unknown\". Tuco digs and elated to find the six bags of gold pieces, but Blondie holds him at gunpoint. He orders him into a hangman's noose, standing balanced precariously on top of an unsteady grave marker beneath a tree. Blondie takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie returns into sight. From the distance, Blondie fires a rifle shot at the rope, dropping Tuco, alive but tied up, onto his share of the gold. Tuco curses loudly while Blondie rides off into the horizon. Eastwood as the iconic \"Man with No Name\" is cool, looking steely eyed, smoking cigars, wearing a few different costumes, ending in his iconic poncho, it is said most of his dialogue was cut to make him more mysterious, this third and final film cemented him as an international superstar. The film does have lip-sync and dubbing issues, it is admittedly long, but for Eastwood, the likeable Wallach, the Civil War battle sequence, the violence, the final showdown, and the memorable score by Ennio Morricone, this is a fantastic classic western. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",

It made such an impression that I remember where exactly I saw this film, and I enjoyed it on TV a few other times afterward. Now, 40 years later my opinion of it is not the same. The only aspect that I still have a high regard for in here in the music, now considered probably one of the \"classic\" soundtracks.However, the three main characters - the men who dominate this film - played by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef - are really nothing but overly crude and excessively violent morons. The worst, of course, is Wallach's \"Taco.\" He makes me want to take a shower after watching this film! He and Eastwood's \"Blondie\" just take turns brutalizing each other through much of the film. Van Cleef's role is considerably less, as \"Sentzenza\" or \"Angel Eyes.\"Wallach's character is just plain insulting. He is a real lowlife and a horrible witness for anyone of the Catholic faith, which is why they probably emphasize the latter with him genuflecting throughout the film while acting like a complete degenerate. It's another slam on that denomination (of which I am not a member, by the way).I usually like Director Sergio Leone's long, dramatic, slow shots and good facial closeups Leone keeps his camera so long on one subject that it gets boring. So, there is a rarely a happy medium in this movie: it's either too violently stupid or too slow. What was once \"good\" has now turned \"bad\" and \"ugly.\"",

        "text": "This classic spaghetti western follows three men as the search for a quarter of a million dollars during the American Civil War. The first 'Angel Eyes' is a gun for hire who learns the name of the man who stole the money from one of his victims. The other two are Tuco and 'Blondie' have been working a scam where Blondie turns in Tuco for the reward money then rescues him to do it again in another town till they have a falling out. Shortly afterwards they come across a Confederate coach that just happens to contain the man Angel Eyes was looking for; he tells Tuco about the gold and the name of the cemetery where it is buried then, while Tuco is getting him water he tells Blondie the name on the grave if either of them are to get their hands on the money they will have to work together. Things don't go according to plan and they have a run in with Angel Eyes; he gets the name of the cemetery from Tuco then offers Blondie the same 50/50 deal he had with Tuco. Ultimately the three of them will be reunited in the cemetery but which of them will get the gold.This is probably the best known of the spaghetti Westerns and deservedly so. It starts with a quiet menace as we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) then shows a touch of cynical humour as we are introduced to Tuco (The Ugly) and Blondie (The Good). The plot is fairly simple but the journey for our protagonists will be anything but as the travel through the war torn American South West towards a grave in a remote cemetery. Their journey will be full of betrayals as each tries to get the information that will cut the others out of the deal. People who are used to classic American made westerns may be a little surprised that there are no heroes here; all three protagonists are venal, cynical and would happily kill the others for the cash this of course is what makes the film so refreshing! It is also quite violent for a film of its time with numerous shootings and plenty of blood.Director Sergio Leone captures the action perfectly and the cast do a fine job. Clint Eastwood brings a dry humour to the role of Blondie, Lee van Cleef is delightfully unpleasant as Angel Eyes and Eli Wallach is great as Tuco. The story has plenty of action, some amusing moments and even a few touching scenes such as when Tuco meets his brother. The Spanish scenery looks spectacular and more like the 'Wild West' than many westerns churned out in California. It is impossible to comment on this film without mentioning Ennio Morricone's score; it is brilliant throughout but there are some scenes that will have the viewer reaching for the remote to crank up the volume; not only does it sound great it also fits with the action. Overall I heartily recommend this; it is deservedly considered a classic.",

Direction by Sergio Leone is magnificent. Ennio Morricone musical score is extraordinary , the soundtrack has been imitated and copied by thousand occasions. Morricone's iconic theme music was designed in places to mimic the sound of a howling coyote . Production design by Carlo Simi and cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli is riveting . Shot in the deserts and landscapes of Spain : Burgos and Almeria , with 1,500 Spanish soldiers as extras .Eli Wallach is very well , as he steals the show , he interprets a humorous and greedy murderous thief , Lee Van Cleef plays a villain and ominous killer and Clint Eastwood makes a dirty and wry 'man without name'.This quintaessential 'Spaguetti' originated great influence of wide range in Western . It was such a good picture that had a great success. Followed by ¨ Once upon a time in West¨and ¨Duck you sucker¨.Rating: very nice, above average 8'5/10",

        "text": "'The Good' is sharp-shooter Blondie (Clint Eastwood), although how someone who runs a bounty racket, betrays his friend, and shoots numerous people dead can be deemed good is beyond me. Bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach) is 'The Ugly', which I think is a little unfair to the bloke: he's no George Clooney, but he's not Quasimodo either. That leaves cold-hearted killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) as 'The Bad', which he most definitely is, even going so far as to kill a child in order to achieve his goals. After Blondie and Tuco chance upon a dying Confederate soldier who reveals to them the whereabouts of a fortune in gold, the pair come to the attention of Angel Eyes, who will do anything to lay his hands on the treasure.The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, the third film in Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy, is an epic spaghetti western that benefits from iconic central characters, an undeniable sense of cool, and, of course, that classic Ennio Morricone soundtrack (Waaawawah, waa waa waa!). Where the film doesn't fare quite so well is in the pacing and storytelling, the basic plot—three guys go in search of hidden treasure—stretched painfully thin, particularly in the Extended Cut, which clocks in at approximately three hours. The expansive historical backdrop—the American Civil War—frequently detracts from the flow of the story and Leone has a tendency to labour a little too much over his style, lingering on his characters for an eternity and repeating similar shots ad nasueum, all of which causes scenes to drag. Fortunately, some nice touches of humour and a couple of neat plot twists help to make matters a little easier to digest.6/10. Not quite as hard-going as Once Upon A Time In The West, but not a patch on the earlier Dollars movies, or indeed, Leone's underrated A Fistful of Dynamite.",

In fact there is a key scene near the end that goes for 5 minutes with just 3 men standing in a triangle, looking at each other, no dialog, tension building, and it doesn't seem over long.. The 'ugly' is Eli Wallach as Tuco. He has no morals, will steal, rape, or kill on a whim, and with a smile on his face, if it suits him. He is good with a gun and has the ability to survive and come back under extreme adversity. The 'good' is Clint Eastwood as Blondie. But 'good' is relative. He and Tuco form a sort of partnership. Tuco is wanted for various crimes and the reward on his head is $2000. So Blondie turns Tuco in, and as he is strung up and about to be hanged, Blondie from a distance shoots the rope so that Tuco can get away. They split the $2000 and run their scam again in a different area.Lee Van Cleef is the menacing Angel Eyes. His motive is only money, as in a stash of gold worth $200,000. He has to track down the man who knows where the gold is buried.The story is set during the Civil War. In their strange association, Tuco and Blondie take turns turning on each other. One of those times as Tuco is forcing Blondie to march through the hot desert without water, they come upon a military wagon. All but one are dead, but the one still alive is the man Angel Eyes is looking for. He manages to tell Tuco the cemetery where the gold is buried, but when Tuco goes for some water to save the man long enough for the whole location, Blondie hears the dying man name the grave, but Blondie did not know the location of the cemetery. So the two men need each other, each with half of the information.With that the rest of the story unfolds. There is lots of gunfire and explosions, and lots of characters die.

        "text": "...and though those last several words could also be attributed to Leone's \"Once Upon a Time\" films (West and America) as well as the other pieces in his trilogy of films with Clint Eastwood- Fistful of Dollars and For a Few More Dollars- arguably this is the most ambitious and spellbinding one of the bunch, and one that has inspired (i.e. Quentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriguez) and will most likely continue to inspire filmmakers and fans into the 21st century. There's something in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly that's nearly (or perhaps is) mythical in it's craft, certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into aspects of humanity.For example, in the first part of the film (this is after the extraordinary introductions to Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, Sentenza or 'Angel Eyes', played by Lee Van Cleef, and as Blondie by a 35/36 year old Clint), Joe gets Tuco out of a hanging, which is something of a regular practice for them, but Joe decides to leave his 'buddy' out in the desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. A little later, the situation gets reversed, as Tuco has a horse and water and Joe doesn't, and they both go to cross the desert. Leone decides to not follow Tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest Tuco and Joe going across that desert, as Joe starts to burn and dry up, going towards a story that will soon unfold. There is something to these scenes that I can barely describe, that they're executed in the mind-set of a Western, but in the abstract Leone lets the audience know this is a story that is bold and bigger than life.What makes much of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly such a huge success is the trust Leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the first two westerns, his trust in his collaborators, and in his leading players as well. I, for one, had to mistakenly figure out that it is near depressing to watch this film on a regular VCR tape due to the pan & scan process. There is such a clear, distinct visual scope that Leone and camera director Tonino Delli Colli achieve that it's practically a must to get the DVD (preferably the extended version, which was Leone's original cut more or less). The editing, too, is unique in many sequences (the climax is the most noted and memorable). The score, with usual collaborator Ennio Morricone, is one of the landmark movie scores, and themes, of not just in the western genre but in all movie history. And the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops to show off: Eastwood, technically, was playing a Joe that took place before Fistful of Dollars, yet by this film had it down to a T (it's still my favorite performance from him, despite having few words and reactions); Cleef's cold, cunning Angel Eyes steals the scenes he's in; ditto for Wallach, who gets under the skin of his co-patriots as much as he sometimes does under the viewer's. If anyone really stays in the mind, at least for me, it's Wallach - especially as he gets the most 'character', and one of the very best scenes is between Tuco and his religious brother. Without that scene, the movie actually wouldn't work quite as well, surprisingly enough. Overall, The Good, the Bad and Ugly, is an entirely satisfying western, at least one of my five favorites ever made, and it's an endearing bravo to all who were involved.",

Filmed on a smaller scale and shorne of its irrelevant episodes, this movie most likely would have emerged as a compulsively fascinating and admirably taut western of classic simplicity. As if to compensate for all the film's irrelevancies, Leone often adopts a style of filming in extreme close-ups, but he tends to draw these scenes out too long to sustain suspense. Still, thanks to superb photography by Delli Colli, music by Morricone and an inspired performance by Eli Wallach – added to a plot that is basically interesting – it would have been difficult to go too far wrong.",

        "text": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an epic spaghetti western film directed by Sergio Leone.It stars Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach in the title roles. The screenplay was written by Age & Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni and Leone, based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone.In the last and the best installment of his so-called \"Dollars\" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed westerns,Eastwood reprised the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad,a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly, a Mexican bandit. \"Blondie\": The Good, a.k.a. the Man with No Name is a subdued, cocksure bounty hunter who teams with Tuco, and Angel Eyes temporarily, to find the buried gold. Blondie and Tuco have an ambivalent partnership. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery where the gold is hidden, but Blondie knows the name of the grave where it is buried, forcing them to work together to find the treasure. In spite of this greedy quest, Blondie's pity for the dying soldiers in the chaotic carnage of the War is evident. \"I've never seen so many men wasted so badly,\" he laments.Van Cleef plays as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopath mercenary named \"Angel Eyes\", who always finishes a job he's paid for which is usually finding and killing—people. When Blondie and Tuco are captured while posing as Confederate soldiers, Angel Eyes is the Union sergeant who interrogates and tortures Tuco, eventually learning the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but not the name on the tombstone. Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance.Wallach plays as Tuco: The Ugly, Tuco Benedicto Pacífico Juan María Ramírez, a comical, oafish though proved also very dangerous, fast talking bandit who is wanted by the authorities for a long list of crimes. Tuco manages to discover the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but he does not know the name of the grave—only Blondie does. This state of affairs forces Tuco to become reluctant partners with Blondie.I consider this the greatest of the westerns made by Leone for it features a compelling story, memorable performances, breathtaking landscapes,interesting characters and most of all,a haunting score by Ennio Morricone that remains a classic up to present.",

        "text": "Spoilers herein.This film revolves around threes of various types and pairings among those threes. The grouping of three that is of interest to me are the cinematic influences behind this film: Hollywood westerns, Italian iconic painting, Japanese starkness in representation. These Italian westerns are important. Most movies are about other movies, but this one affected much of what followed. The western vocabulary was mature and popular well before movies, and with the detective story drove the first revolution in modern mass publishing. Its simple abstractions were converted to film (then radio and TeeVee) without change: the boy scout cowboy in the usually white hat, often singing. (In fact the modern pop country music borrows from this simple vocabulary and reference to the `genuine.') But all that, including the country music bit is pretty flat, stupid and dull.Italian cinema is based on a similar set of national icons, specifically religious icons. It is a more visual, visceral painterly vocabulary. Equally simple in stereotypes, but instead there are religiously based connections that give the impression of depth. Symbology is expected, even demanded. To this add postwar notions of irony which permeated European popular art. So the good guy was still good, but in a twisted way -- the twists shifting according to the chaos he encountered.In the US, John Ford was creating soft lush panoramas that would subliminally inspire a generation of environmentally aware viewers, but something more important came rushing in from Japan: Kurosawa. His films are abstract, directly evolved from Japanese watercolor narratives. These are also lush and beautiful, but not soft -- instead dusty, gritty, sometimes cruel. This world is not placid, merely a machine to test color and honor.In the Eastwood/Leone films, these three influences were deliberately enfolded. And a whole world's visual vocabulary shifted. In the US, we have since reinvented a part of our national character to ally with these images. (America's love affair with guns is a recent phenomenon.) How powerful cinema can be!This film may be recommended by others for entertainment value or something similar. That's fine, but I think it should be seen to help you understand the default world you are handed, so that you can put it into perspective -- to see that much of it is man-made.",

        "text": "It's debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!Here for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?Such is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.The story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into \"The Battle of Branston Bridge\", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It's exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffrè as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.The Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone's musical compositions. It's a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood's Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.There's obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here's the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone's classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!From the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10",

The first hour is introducing the three characters--the remaining two hours deal with their journey.This has been called an epic and operatic western. I agree! It's beautifully directed by Sergio Leone. He knew how to frame shots and use the wide screen perfectly. Most of the film is told by images not dialogue. Heck there's no dialogue for the first 10 minutes! There's plenty of shoot outs and action. The acting is OK. Eastwood was never a great actor but he's OK here. Wallach gets annoying but that's his character. Van Cleef is just so-so but has little screen time.There's one big problem here--the length. There is no reason for this to go on for three hours. Scenes ramble on inconclusively quite a bit. There's also a long battle scene and talk with a drunken captain that add nothing to the main storyline.

A tendency to elaborate on already elongated Scenes to add to the already established Suspense......The Character Tuco becomes relentlessly obnoxious, overbearing, irritating, and unlikeable immediately and this keeps up for almost 3 Hours. It is an overacted Performance that makes the Movie less engaging......The length seems padded and indulgent.The Ugly......All the Characters, their Personalities and the Makeup.

        "text": "Italian-born film director Sergio Leone completed his western trilogy with Clint Eastwood in what constituted a prequel to the \"Dollars\" movies. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" qualifies as a sprawling tale of greed about three men and their tenacious search for a Confederate strong box containing $200-thousand dollars in gold coins. This memorable United Artists continued a trend in Leone's filmmaking. He kept making films that were bigger and bigger. Eventually, he would make an even bigger western than \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" entitled \"Once Upon a Time in the West.\" Previously, Leone's first oater \"Fistful of Dollars\" had been produced on a shoestring budget and shared sets with another Continental western lensed in Spain. When Leone produced \"For Few Dollars More,\" he imported a second American actor, veteran heavy Lee Van Cleef, and commissioned art director Carlo Simi to construct an entire western town in Almeria, Spain. Reportedly, the El Paso town set cost more than the budget for \"Fistful of Dollars.\" Meanwhile, Van Cleef reunited with Leone and Eastwood for \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,\" and Leone imported yet another American actor. Eli Wallach, who had played the bandit chieftain in John Sturges' classic \"The Magnificent Seven,\" signed on as the third American actor. Essentially, Leone cast Eastwood again as a bounty hunter designated as \"The Good\" and called him 'Blondie,\" while Van Cleef played \"the Bad,\" and Wallach appeared as \"the Ugly.\" \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" became Leone's most expensive western to date and he set the action against the American Civil War. Naturally, all three eponymous characters are a little larger than life themselves. The relationship between the Eastwood as well as the Van Cleef character changed drastically because Van Cleef was not playing Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Ironically, Van Cleef's character was named 'Angel Eyes,' and he made his living as a man who hunts down other men and kills them for a price. No, \"the Bad\" isn't a bounty hunter. Meantime, \"the Good\" brings in a slimy, profane Mexican bandit named Tuco. He collects the reward on Tuco's head, and later shoots the noose from around Tuco's neck, so the slippery Mexican can escape. Later, Blondie and Tuco split the money. This relationship comes to an end because Blondie doesn't think that Tuco will be worth more than $3-thousand. Clocking in at 180 minutes, \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" bristles with shoot-outs. Live is cheap in the world of the Italian western and the horses outnumber the corpses. Money means everything. The three protagonists refuse to let a national catastrophe like the Civil War interfere with their plans to find the cashbox. Eventually, they do and confront each other in a massive graveyard to shoot it out. Anybody who considers himself or herself a connoisseur of Spaghetti westerns must watch \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" This savage western made quite an impression on audiences when it was released and Grammy Award-winning composer Ennio Morricone's orchestral soundtrack emerged as a hit on American music charts.",

        "text": "Out of all the movies I have seen, this must be one of the few that I have seen over a dozen times already. And that's coming from a non western fan! You clearly don't have to be a western fan to have a love and appreciating for this movie. Every movie lover in general should be capable of appreciating the quality, art and talent that is all present in this movie.It's one of those rare movies in which everything comes together perfectly. The story, the directing, the acting, the settings, the music. Everything fits and works out perfectly. All elements strengthen each other as well. The music strengthens its images, the director its actors, etcetera. Would the movie had been just as good and unforgettable with a different cast? Or different music, or a different director? Probably not. It would be like replacing an instrument in a Mozart composition, or changing some of the colors in a Picasso painting. All of the elements need each other to become the great masterpiece that \"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo.\" is.One of the reasons why I have always loved this movie is because it's buildup as a real adventurous movie, in which the hunt for a treasure plays a very central role. It takes the main characters to all kinds of different places, where they meet all kinds of different people and each time run into different problems as well. Really, this movie is basically an adventure movie, disguised as a western. It also really makes this movie unique in its genre and so extremely likable and easy to watch, time after time, despite its long running time.Also the interaction between the three main character is just great. They often trade roles and alliances with each other and constantly try to be one step ahead of the other. They never thrust each other and for good reasons. None of the characters are truly good or bad, even though the title of the movie might suggest otherwise.And needless to say that the three main parts are also perfectly cast ones. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef all rarely have been better. And they also make it real difficult to pick a favorite character. Each of them has their own qualities and certain amount of charm and likability level to them.There is also no big surprise in it that the movie is really skilfully directed and put together by Sergio Leone, who obviously was a master of the genre. He perfectly combines both visual and story elements, with an equal amount of eye for detail for both. He pretty much perfected the spaghetti western genre at the time pretty much on his own and his influences can still be seen back in modern movies now days.One of his finest moments of course comes during its final shootout. But I actually think it are the movie its last 30 minutes in general that are just great, the moment Tuco first enters the cemetery. It's really something that's among the greatest moments out of movie history.The shootout, or Mexican standoff, itself is really nothing short of brilliant. Its compositions, the editing, its close-ups, the Ennio Morricone music. Could had things been more perfect? It has such a great buildup, in which the characters are slowly moving and looking around at first. The music helps to buildup the tension, then it swells up and when you expect things to go down it goes suddenly entirely quiet. However then the music suddenly starts again and the buildup gets even more intense, with fast cuts and even more extreme closeups. Truly one of the best and most memorable movie moments out of movie history.The only shame about this movie is that there are actually still people out there who haven't seen it yet!10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

However, despite Leone's talented direction, the film seems to drag in some scenes, and the length is almost unbearable on multiple viewings. The plot is very good, intricate, yet simple enough for the mainstream crowd; the way it keeps developing through twists and unexpected situations is also great. It keeps your interest, at least the first few times you see it. The pace is bad in some scenes, where the movie seems to drag on endlessly. I don't think I've been able to sit through the whole thing more than once(granted, technically that's enough, but a film should have some re-watch value, I think). The acting is very good; Clint Eastwood is the embodiment of the spaghetti-western spirit. Lee Van Cleef is excellent as well, as is Eli Wallach. The characters are well-written, interesting and credible. The direction is, as always when it comes to Leone's films, excellent. Apart from the few scenes where the plot drags, Leone keeps a great atmosphere and mood throughout the film. The action is about as good as it gets when it comes to spaghetti-western: excellent, intense and very, very cool. The dialog is excellent. The script is well-written. The soundtrack is among Ennio Morricone's best work. All in all, if you're into westerns at all, this is pretty much *the* western. It drags a little too much in a few scenes, though, and is probably best enjoyed if you only see it once. I recommend it to any fan of westerns, particularly spaghetti-westerns, as well as any of the three main actors, or Sergio Leone. 9/10",

But Sergio Leone's simply magnificent film did just that. The first thing I asked myself when it was over was, \"Why did I wait so long to see it?\" For a cinephile, it's just utter joy to watch this movie. It's beautiful -- beautifully composed, beautifully scored. Every shot is a work of art by itself. But what surprised me the most was how funny and playful the movie is. It's like reading a Charles Dickens novel, waiting to see how the various plot threads are going to come together and what crazy twist the storyteller is going to throw your way next.Watching Sergio Leone's movie made me instantly appreciate Quentin Tarantino less. He obviously adores Leone and borrows (steals) from him outright, but what seems daring and original in Tarantino's work feels instantly derivative when you see the real deal and realize it was made over forty years ago yet feels more alive than almost anything filmmakers are putting out there today.Grade: A+",

This scam serves them quite well until a stolen army payroll enters the equation at which point, together with a ferrety-faced individual, the three of them find themselves reluctant allies and less reluctant antagonists as, against a backdrop of the Civil War, they try to track down the payroll.Let me set out the bits which I would quibble with. The Spanish locations - undoubtedly photogenic - don't look even slightly like the places they are supposed to represent. The dubbing on the non-English speaking cast has some places where the English speech is hopelessly out of synchronisation with the mouth movements of the cast members. And, sad to say, it does ramble somewhat.So what is good about it? Well, Ennio Morricon's score is wonderful, and I don't just mean the seminal theme: it is full of haunting melody and dramatic arrangements. The set pieces are brilliantly staged, especially the bridge sequence and the entire closing section. Plus, notwithstanding that this is his third appearance, it is an education to see Eastwood's seminal character cemented into iconhood, especially as his costume is assembled bit by bit throughout the film.Take no notice of my quibbles! It is a classic!",

He represents \"the Bad\" in the title. Meanwhile, a murderous thief named \"Tuco\" (Eli Wallach) and a bounty hunter nicknamed \"Blondie\" (Clint Eastwood) have also found out about the hidden chest and forge an uneasy alliance between them in order to get their hands on it as well. These two represent \"the Ugly\" and \"the Good\" respectfully. That said, all three must overcome obstacles and treachery by each other to get what they are after. Anyway, having given a short synopsis of the movie I would just like to say that this is probably the best \"Spaghetti Western\" ever filmed. There is plenty of action, a good soundtrack and all three give excellent performances. And although it is a bit long (161 minutes) the story flows smoothly from one incredible scenario to another.

        "text": "Going downstairs the day after my birthday to check if any post had arrived,I was thrilled to discover that a very kind friend had sent me the uncut version of Sergio Leone's highly praised Spaghetti Western The Good The Bad And The Ugly on DVD as a surprise present!Having found the last Leone film I had seen, (A Fistful of Dynamite)to be outstanding,I decided to get set right away and experience Leone's epic Spaghetti Western for the very first time\nView on the film:Charging into the Wild West to Ennio Morricone's extraordinary score the screenplay by co-writer/(with Agenore Incrocci/Furio Scarpelli and Luciano Vincenzoni) directing auteur Sergio Leone tremendously makes each of the three main characters distinct individuals, whilst gradually threading the films plot round the trio,with the initially three separate plot lines all joining up to create one wonderful thrilling Spaghetti Western as Angel Eyes,Tuco and Blondie's addiction in getting their hands on the gold starts to seep through their veins.Bringing a tough earthiness to the outlaw, Clint Eastwood gives a mesmerizing turn, making \"the man with no name\" look less a mythical superhero cowboy,and more someone who whilst cunning,is also able to get caught by surprise and left to dry to death in the middle of nowhere.Despite being the one with the least amount of screen time out of the three main actors,Lee Van Cleef gives a menacing performance as Angel Eyes,who even when in the background of scenes gives the film a chilling atmosphere of darkness descending on any area that he is closing in on.On the opposite side of the wicked Van Cleef and the smart,cunning Eastwood is the stunning Eli Wallach as Tuco, as Wallach creates an unforgettable love/hate friendship with Blondie as Tuco shows Blondie that he is far more intelligent than he may appear,and also creates a character that really helps the audience to enter \"the world\" of the film,due to Tuco having the perfect mix of a good comedic side and also having a charismatic go-with-the-flow attitude.Joined by a classic score,cast and script,director Sergio Leone & cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli bring the films thrilling Wild West- Civil War setting to vivid life with his gripping stylisation.Leone holds the trio from getting pulled into the total bleakness of the Civil War that is taking place around them, by placing the main focus on the chase for the gold,as Leone keeps the movie moving at a lightning fast pace, from the almost three dimensional,fantastic endless sets to the nail-biting gun battles where Leone uses his elegant wide shots to show the distant between each character and his beautiful extreme close-ups to build up a huge amount of tension between the good the bad,and the ugly.",

        "text": "Released in 1966 and directed by Sergio Leone, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" stars Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach as the titular three men (respectively) who are after hidden gold, buried in a Civil War cemetery somewhere. Of course, none of these men trust each other and the Civil War happens to be raging around them.There's no question that Leone created a different filmic genre by melding the hysterically overdone Italo grand opera with Spanish picaresque convention. A Spanish term, Picaro means \"rogue\" or \"rascal\", and the picaresque yarn is usually sardonic, featuring the misadventures of roguish protagonists of low stature who live by their wits in a crooked world, and told with realistic and humorous detail. Here 'Blondie' (Eastwood) and Tuco (Wallach) are the two picaros, who have stumbled upon a way to make good money claiming bounty rewards for Tuco's many sins.Someone criticized the film on the grounds that the geography doesn't look anything like the actual landscapes where these Civil War events occurred. Wrong. The events in the film take place in extreme West Texas and the New Mexican Territory. \"Santa Fe\" is even mentioned a couple of times. When Angel Eyes meets Baker, his employer, near the beginning it's in El Paso, which is 250 miles south of Santa Fe. The topography of Almería, Spain, is an acceptable geographical substitute.Admittedly this Spaghetti Western is overrated, overlong and has some slow stretches, not to mention amoral & one-dimensional characters and a story that idolizes lucre above everything; it also has campy and goofy elements, which kills any realism. But, if you can handle all that, Eastwood is the coolest Westerner, Lee Van Cleef is the ultimate bad axx, the exceptional score by Ennio Morricone is iconic and the film pulsates with hip style (for 1966, that is). In short, there's some good in this movie, even greatness, which explains the ridiculous gushing of some reviewers; but, let's be honest, there's also some bad and ugly.Director Leone strained to explain the theme: \"We all have some bad in us, some ugliness, some good. And there are people who appear to be ugly, but when we get to know them better, we realize that they are more worthy.\" One reviewer took this and claimed that each of the three protagonists embody the three parts of human nature with Tuco representing the id (i.e. the \"flesh\") and Blondie representing the ego (i.e. the mind with its power of volition). Okay, that fits. But then he tried to argue that Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) represents the superego, which goes to show that he didn't understand this structural model of the psyche seeing as how the superego is the idealistic, heroic side of human nature (aka the \"spirit\") and Angel Eyes in the movie is anything BUT.The film runs 163 minutes (the version I viewed) and was shot in Burgos, Granada, Almería & Colmenar Viejo, Spain, with interiors done in Rome. The screenplay was written by Leone & Luciano Vincenzoni with the additions of Agenore Incrocci & Furio Scarpelli.GRADE: B-",

Even the final shootout was too much; I just wanted Leone to get on with it.

For one, the framing and composition in this film are amazing. Not sure I've seen such effective use of widescreen in another western. Leone knows how to make the western landscapes eye- catching. Each of the film's stars fits his character well (Wallach, especially, who just seems to relish Tuco's streetrat sense of guile). And it's just one double-cross after another, right up until the very end. It's fun from that standpoint. Just overinflated.7/10",

First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio! 10/10",

        "text": "Sergio Leone is arguably the most visionary director of all time. They say that before he even had a written script he could picture exactly what was to be on screen and the camera's direction in leading his characters. It was Sergio's World - an alternate place in an alternate time that he was free to control. He controlled the audience and his story like no other director.To me, his best film was the one that was on many critics' ten worst films of 1984 list: \"Once Upon a Time in America.\" I love the finished director's cut, the cut of the film Sergio Leone himself wanted and pictured in his mind while filming the movie. Unfortunately, the editor of the film cut everything into a two-hour picture and messed up the timeline for the theatrical release in 1984 - the result was a disastrous motion picture that now, with the director's cut, stands as one of the best of all time. James Woods once said that one of the critics who named it the worst film of 1984 later named it the best film of the decade.\"Once Upon a Time in America\" was Sergio's dream project, one that took him ten years to get on the big screen and ultimately killed him by sucking the life out of him, but \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1967) was undoubtably his most visual film. The extreme close-ups, the great way he lets the audience see nothing but what he wants - as far as he saw it, the audience should not wonder what is off-screen; whatever is within the frames is all there is. Compared to \"Once Upon a Time\" it seems a bit more corny and unrealistic - but it is a spaghetti western, and that is simply the point. It stands above the rest as the best spaghetti western of them all.Leone is best remembered for his extreme close-ups. Director Quentin Tarantino once said, among many other things about Leone, his role model, that when he started out he knew not many camera directions, so when he wanted an extreme close-up in a film he'd shout, \"I want a Sergio Leone on this guy!\" Quentin Tarantino has such a respect for Leone that he even suggested the title \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" to director Robert Rodriguez, the title, of course, a derivation on \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" and \"Once Upon a Time in America,\" both films of Sergio Leone.\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" a.k.a. \"Buono, il bruto, il cattivo, il,\" is the final film in the Dollars Trilogy - \"A Fistful of Dollars,\" \"For a Few Dollars More,\" and, of course, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\" I have yet to see this film's predecessors, but I doubt they are much better than this film. It isn't really about anything per se - it's a showcase of art and camera techniques. It is a showcase for Sergio Leone and a great one at that. I have no real care about the themes or outcomes - I simply enjoy being controlled by a masterful director such as Leone. When there's a director who can literally push in and give the audience specifically what he wants them to see, without the audience feeling cheated, you know you have a great director, because there's a fine line between a selfish director and a visionary director. Leone has a bit of both, so indistinct that it is hard to notice. The same thing was done in Carol Reed's \"The Third Man\" (1949), and the same is done here. And it is pulled off without any objections from the audience.Clint Eastwood is The Good - he rides around the desert kidnapping criminals, giving them to the authorities and claiming reward money, and then freeing the criminals before they are to be hanged. He meets Tuco (Eli Wallach), a.k.a. The Ugly, and does his routine - but The Ugly fights back and, ultimately, kidnaps good ol' Clint, taking him into the desert and practically torturing him in the heat.Then The Good overhears where a stash of gold is hidden from a dying man. The Ugly wants the gold so much that he nurses The Good back to health so that they can go off on a wild goose chase and search for the treasure. But there is already another man searching for the treasure - Angel Eyes, a.k.a. The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a man whose skills at gunfighting match those of The Good, a true marksman if ever there was such a thing.There's a terrific scene towards the end of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" where three men have found the gold buried in a graveyard. At exactly the same time. They each have guns pointed at each other. They could all pull their triggers and die, or kill one of the three and the two could then take the money and split it. Leone zooms in with his extreme close-ups and truly gives the audience a sense of paranoia, a sense of what it would feel like in a circumstance such as that. Sergio Leone is a great director, perhaps the most visionary of all time, and now that his films are turning up again with their intended running times, the realization strikes and sinks in.He's an even better director than we thought he was.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",

I wish my jumpy sequence might not hinder the logical understanding of the film, although it is never a major concern of Mr. Leone and his team.I cannot claim myself an ardent Western genre follower, also without any trickle of fetish towards neither guns or other weaponry, nor killing for fun, plus being an out-and-out urbanite, my natural response over the usual tonal settings of Western films is quite nonchalant (also the bleak milieu is not my preference to admire), what I need to fathom is whether it will evince any on-screen dynamite to maintain a buoyant vibe through its storytelling and action. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, without any doubt, has done a crack job here, the lengthy narrative never cease to fall into tepid, three leading characters are richly depicted with accumulated details and minor plots, Eli Wallach's the ugly, who receives the most amount of screen time and rendered as a complete hypocrisy and opportunist, is the arch-protagonist, Eastwood and Van Cleef's roles are less colorful but more pragmatic to be idolized in the hero and anti-hero cinema realm. One cannot evade Morricone's masterly work (not only in Leone's filmography), but here, his knack of enhancing the whole film's temperament has been comprehensively facilitated, the hyena-mimicking theme tune for me is something worth persisting for my entire life. The very much discussed and highly appreciated Mexican standoff could be regarded as the pinnacle of the wholesome western films, Leone's obsession with relentless close-ups is another trademark of its own kind. Leone's film career is an underachieved one, and most of his fame has been accruing after his untimely decease in 1989 at the age of 60, with only 7 feature films under his rein (another one I have watched is his swan song ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, 1984, 8/10), if only he could live a bit longer, his feat would easily stride outside his comfort zone and evolve himself and his work with the time, like what Martin Scorsese has attained. What should I whine about the film? I really cannot say it explicitly, the only thing impedes me from rating it higher is the innate trait of the grumpy and grubby world, which seems to me like a pit on earth.",

Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad.However, I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.Now I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director, but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures, and this is no exception, where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope, with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman, the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue, which on the whole is excellent, Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it.And the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here, while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel, and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee, whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good, and indeed it was, and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir, and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really, as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen, who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf, the delivery to the camera, the delivery of the lines, perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom, yes he is dashing and handsome, but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland.In conclusion, a great start. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

        "text": "Director Peter Jackson and wife Fran Walsh have successfully created an epic movie in both look and feel to equal J. R. R. Tolkien's novel (itself awarded the title of \"book of the century\"), bringing to the big screen a film nearly flawless in its execution. My biggest disappointment is that two chapters are missing from the novel - Tom Bombadil and the following encounter with the barrow-wrights - but everything else is present and correct.Visually the film is stunning, and Jackson's decision to shoot it entirely in New Zealand is one that pays off. From the incredibly lush green opening scenes of the Shire, to the enchanting elvish woods, to the imposing mountains and plains, it really is a great film to look at and enjoy the backdrop. Even the computer-generated images, like that of Mount Doom, are pretty realistic. Jackson's fluid camera leads to some great sweeping shots through orc-infested mines, huge towers, cameras in places you've never dreamed of. The soundtrack is also perfect, with Howard Shore's suspenseful, exciting, and emotional score a real plus, especially with the cool chanting that fills the Mines of Moria sequence. On top of this, great stuff is done with sound effects - in particular one scene involving a horn suddenly blowing had me jumping in my seat with its realism.I don't really need to examine the story, because it sticks closely to the book with so few minor changes that it's impeccable. The script is intelligent and well-written, the characters charismatic and believable in the situations they encounter. Despite a three hour running time, the film never drags, even in some of the slower sequences - I just didn't want it to be over while I was watching it. The costumes, sets and appearances - down to the hobbits' hairy feet - are all exactly as you would picture them in the book. Jackson's bizarre, arty depiction of life in the \"netherworld\" when Frodo puts on the ring and becomes invisible is as good as it could ever have been - spooky, supernatural and utterly weird. Lighting, pacing, suspense, tension, and the rest - it's all here and done 100% correctly for an overall brilliant effect.Elijah Wood seemed an odd choice to me for the lead role, but I immediately fell in love with his character. Through his acting he creates an emotional, weak in body but strong in spirit hero, a real centre piece for the film to evolve around, and the film makes great use of the actor's slightly odd eyes (especially in the sequence in which he nearly becomes a wraith). Ian McKellen is also excellent as Gandalf and seems to have been perfectly cast in the role, making it his own. Then there's the fellowship itself - Viggo Mortensen excels as the proud and just Strider (later Aragorn), especially in the action stakes where he fights with such fierce determination that he's a presence to behold. Orlando Bloom is fine as the elf warrior Legolas, and moves as fast with his bow as he does in the book. Screen stalwart John Rhys-Davies IS Gimli the dwarf, and couldn't be better. Then there's Sean Astin - lovable as the dopey but loyal Sam Gamgee, and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan in slight comic relief roles as hobbit buddies Pip and Merry. Finally, kudos to Sean Bean, for creating in Boromir a flawed but deeply likable and understandable character, with a sympathetic performance that eclipses all of the actor's previous work - bravo.The action sequences are magnificent and really get the heart going - they put you into the middle of the action with all the blood, sweat and clanging steel, and are edge-of-the-seat stuff. Highlights include Strider fighting the ring-wraiths with his burning brand on Weathertop and the final assault by orcs on the fellowship, which leads to one of the most noble deaths ever in a film. And what of the special effects? In a film dominated by CGI work, I'm happy to say that most are unnoticeable. The digital manipulation to create four-foot hobbits is sometimes dodgy but most of the time you don't notice. The backdrops and effects are great, expensive looking but solid and real at the same time - whoever said they look \"cartoony\" just got it wrong.My favourite scene in the movie is the Mines of Moria sequence - a fantasy fan's dream come true, and the best on screen depiction of a Dungeons & Dragons game so far. The lurker in the lake is a Lovecraftian monster par excellence and the spooky and atmospheric trip through the corpse-strewn deserted mines exceptionally eerie stuff. Then follows a fantastic battle with a cave troll, thankfully on screen for a fair amount of time so we get to admire the fluid and superb effects, and then a truly gob-smacking encounter with the fiery Balrog, just as you imagine it from the book. This half an hour is probably the best film sequence I've ever seen, flawless and perfect in its depiction - amazing. A highlight of what is an impressive and epic film throughout, and a must see for any film fan worth their salt - I can't recommend this film highly enough, and plan to watch it again before the cinema run expires. In my opinion this is better than any STAR WARS movie or HARRY POTTER - and easily one of the best fantasy movies ever made, although it has to be said the competition isn't exactly stiff.

Gandalf (Ian McKellen) arrives in the Shire to visit Bilbo. Bilbo goes on a personal journey leaving the burden of the ring to Frodo (Elijah Wood). Frodo sets off on a quest to save the world with his best friend Samwise (Sean Astin). Along the way, others join this Fellowship of the Ring.Peter Jackson delivers a near-perfect execution of this fantasy classic. The CGI is state-of-the-art but the movie does not get bogged down with battles of massive armies. The action is visceral and thrilling. The characters are compelling and the performances are near perfect. The internal conflicts over the ring actually drive the narrative and ultimately generates great paranoia and isolation for Frodo.

I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.",

        "text": "\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" is the first of Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\"-trilogy and possibly my favorite from the three movies. After a sole writing nomination for one of his earlier works, Jackson started his big run with the Academy Awards here back in 2002. The first hour was pretty great here. I thought the female narrator was a good introduction to the films and I also really enjoyed looking at all the juicy green from the Shire. And we should be glad the headless horseman did not manage to get little Frodo after 60 minutes as then the whole tale would have been over already. That Frodo seemed quite a survivalist anyway looking at the quantity of situations where he came out alive, almost like the Chosen One from \"The Matrix\". However, the actor who plays Agent Smith is one of the good ones here. They all seem to have a talent to stay away from death, even if they are getting in the most dangerous situations, like Gandalf falling deep down and becoming the White Gandalf. This applies also to many other characters who keep getting missed by Orc arrows by centimeters. Lucky bunch.Anyway, back to the story. This is obviously a fantasy drama, but it has its fair share of comedic moments as well. Most of these involve the two other Hobbits or pretty much every scene with Gimli the Dwarf, for example when he asks to not be pulled on his beard. While we're at it, that nasty creature down there in the dwarfs' graveyard is truly disgusting. Most of the film is about the journey though, the whole adventure when the group is still together. At the end, they split up. Frodo and Sam keep going to destroy the ring. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli try to free the other two hobbits. I can't say the film did not drag a single second during its 3.5 hours runtime (for me it mostly did during the fight sequences), but at least we get to watch beautiful landscapes and cinematography from start to finish. Also all the creatures included here are fairly special and memorable.One of my favorite scenes is when we see Frodo's grief and regret when Gandalf allegedly dies as Frodo was the one who wanted to take the Moria route and Gandalf did not. Another one I liked was the Elf marching scene early on when Sam says it makes him sad for some reason. It's almost like a special march of animals (penguins for example, or birds flying south). Two scenes I did not like that much were when we saw what the ring does to people. Bilbo and Galadriel look almost like horror movie creatures during their respective scenes and that is not a course the film takes at any other point. This film is all about Sauron's invisible danger and these two transformation scenes did not work in its favor. Nonetheless, Saruman felt more like the main antagonist in this film here, first of all of course because of his fight against Gandalf and then also because he pretty much commands the Orc army. During one scene he gives the order to kill all those who accompany the Hobbits. Then there is the usual components to this kind of movies, such as the enemy within the group, who (luckily to Frodo?) gets killed by the Orc army.Elijah Wood was one of the most promising young actors back then, so it was no surprise he got cast. The bigger surprise is possibly Sean Astin, who was not that well-known, but worked wonders during the whole trilogy and is possibly my favorite actor from the whole cast taking all three films together. Today he is possibly the epitome of the loyal friend in movie history. The movie ends with an Enya song (also Academy Award nominated). She did the super successful song connected with the 9/11-tragedy some months earlier and her song here works very well too. Taking all components together, this is a pretty good movie and a must-see for everybody with an interest in the fantasy genre.",

        "text": "Wizard Gandalf retrieves an evil ring from Bilbo Baggins he finds it's true nature and must destroy.  Frodo, a hobbit with a pure enough heart to resist the ring, is selected to make the journey to destroy the ring.The story here is very heavy and a good job has been made of trimming down the story to make it accessible to those not familiar with the story.  The characters are quite well developed - the beauty of the film is that it knows it will be a trilogy of films so it doesn't have to rush past characterisation where other films would need to get down to action quickly to ensure that it can get a sequel greenlighted.The visuals are fantastic, the special effects are brilliant and are mixed well with New Zealand's natural scenery to great effect, there's no doubting that Jackson can cope with such a grand canvas to work on.  The action scenes are also very well handled and the monster special effects are mostly good (only occasionally it is obvious that some are computer generated).The main problem with the film is that it isn't a lot of fun.  I know it wants to be serious but it also needs to be fun for the audience to watch, three hours is a long time to sit listening to lots of talk about family trees and ancient quests etc.  I didn't want comedy but it all took itself too seriously to be totally enjoyable.  Another problem with it is that the pacing is all off - the film has a set pattern that goes all the way through, first a talky scene with slow camera movements, then the music changes, the camera starts zooming around and we enter an action scene, then back to a talky scene, then an action/chase scene and so on.  It all gets a bit tiresome with it's continual cut between action/talking/action/talking with a relentless monotony.  There's nothing wrong with the content but it all gets a bit tiresome after a while.The cast are roundly great - almost totally well cast with the exception of Hugo Weaving who looks, sounds and acts just like his character in the Matrix - it makes it too distracting.  Wood as Frodo is a little too serious at times, gazing off into the distance and delivering straight dialogue. Bean and Mortensen are both great, Bean especially with his flawed character struggling against the ring.  The best character in the film is the ring! The film suffers from not having a bad guy to focus on (Christopher Lee is built up but he isn't the main source of evil).  Giving the ring itself the ability to tempt and manipulate and speak, this makes it the main evil character and makes the quest even more tense.Overall it's a big grown up blockbuster with amazing effects but it isn't very much fun to watch (not just laughs but basic enjoyment).  A good film but far from perfect - 4 out of 5.",

        "text": "When I first read \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" Trilogy back in the early 1970's, I recall saying to myself that the story would make a wonderful movie. \"Star Wars\" still hadn't come out yet, and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R. Tolkien, it was simply best left to the imagination.Well, imagination has found life in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy, just as the books did for the written word. Upon first seeing it during it's initial release, I couldn't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure. Everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind; it was as if Peter Jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on.I feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of Middle Earth, as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation. For example, when the Black Riders appear for the first time, it's difficult to grasp what they're all about, other than the fact that they're after the ring. Strider's explanation of the Nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men, neither alive nor dead, who always feel the power of the ring. Coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place.The real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other. Though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear, can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves, dwarfs, hobbits and wizards actually exist. Even orcs and evil Uruk hai have a place in this world, for without the danger they pose there is no triumph.If the movie captures your imagination and you haven't read the trilogy or it's prequel \"The Hobbit\", you'll be doing yourself a favor to do so. There in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as Elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of Middle Earth. It's a world easy to get lost in, and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land, people, and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone.",

Basically, long ago in Middle-Earth, an evil lord Sauron in the land of Mordor forged a ring of evil powers in the fires of Mount Doom. Years later Bilbo Baggins (Sir Ian Holm) of The Shire finds this ring and leaves it to Frodo (Elijah Wood). Accompied by a fellowship of friends/heroes he must return this ring to Mount Doom to destroy it. This fellowship includes Sam (The Goonie's Sean Astin), Pippin (introduction by Billy Boyd), Merry (introduction by Dominic Monaghan, now known in TV's Lost), Gandalf the Grey wizard (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Sir Ian McKellen), Aragorn/Strider (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean) and Legolas (introduction by Orlando Bloom).

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these \"Rings\" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the \"Fellowship\" film.Anyway, \"Fellowship,\" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.",

        "text": "This is a great film, unlike most films that are the first part of a trilogy you really do have to watch the remaining films to get the most out of the story as there is no sense of closure at the end of the film, it is merely the end of one part of their quest and the beginning of the next. This is not a bad thing; just make sure you'll have enough time to watch all three films fairly close together. The film is very long but I don't think there were any scenes that could have been removed or trimmed so the length is justified.I think the film followed the book fairly well, although I confess it has been a while since I read it. After a short prologue where we are given a history of The Ring. We then find ourself in the Shire, the home of the Hobbits; the wizard Gandalf has come to attend a birthday party for his old friend Bilbo Baggins. During the party Bilbo announces that he is going to be leaving the Shire, he then slips a ring onto his finger and vanishes into thin air. When he takes the ring off again he is confronted by Gandalf who tells him he must leave the ring behind when he goes as it is dangerous.Unfortunately his use of the ring has been noticed by the evil Sauron who has dispatched nine wraiths; horsemen who's sole purpose is to retrieve the ring for their master. Gandalf instructs Bilbo's nephew Frodo to take the ring to Elves at Rivendell. On the way he and three Hobbit friends meet up with a mysterious man who helps them flee from the riders although Frodo is wounded and needs the Elves to recover. At Rivendell the group learn that their quest is not over, they must continue on to Sauron's land of Mordor where they can finally destroy the ring. The group are joined by Gandalf, an Elf called Legolas, Gimli the Dwarf and a man called Boromir.This film doesn't go as far as Mordor, in fact it only shows the first part of the journey which will see our heroes battling Orcs, other strange creatures and their own desire for the power the ring may bring; not all of the group will survive.As this is a fantasy film they are a lot of special effects, thankfully they are so well done that they don't look like effects even though we know they must be, I especially liked how they made the hobbits look so small, had I not seen the actors in other films it would have been almost possible to believe that the actors really were that short. Peter Jackson did a great job on this film getting a good performance from all his actors; a combination of well known veteran actors and young actors who will probably go onto be stars although I suspect this is the film they will be remembered for.",

The first hour is actually rather leisurely, with an introduction to the Hobbit village that is sweet if a little slow (and hampered by show-off fireworks effects). But once the first journey is undertaken by the Fellowship, frenetic action scenes, too many battles, and countless close-ups of THE RING in someone's palm take over. The direction is deadening, relying far too heavily on special effects and sound effects to juice the narrative. The acting is good except from the women (Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are poorly-used) and we get elaborate glimpses of magical worlds without ever gaining a sense of their histories. Blanchett rules the Forest of Women, and indeed it is eye-popping, but the scene is a bummer, only included so Blanchett could help forecast Elijah Wood's future (scenes from the next installment!). The movie is not a cheat: it packs in a lot of astounding action, but that's all it is, action for it's own sake. The art directors go for overkill in dazzling this thing up, but lovers of intriguing and substantial content will feel undernourished.

A deal I couldn't refuse!Well, last night I watched the film, along with good friends Frank and Judy who happen to be \"Ringheads.\" The filming was absolutely gorgeous. The DVD transfer is about the best I have seen so far, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is very dynamic and beautiful. In short about all one could ask for in a DVD. Plus, there is a second disk which has over two hours of \"extras\", several \"making of\" plus a 10-minute preview of the second installment due out later this year. While the movie itself is very interesting, especially the first one-third which sets the stage for the journey that \"the fellowship of the ring\" will undertake, to ultimately return the \"one ring\" to the volcano, NEVER did I feel that this was a \"great\" film. As the story unfolds there are increasingly brutal battles to be fought, one after another, with little story between each battle. While that may make for really good reading, where you can create exactly the images you want in your own mind, as a film it gets to be a bit much. I actually became bored, with yet another battle and narrow escape. Like adding too much spice to a good meal.As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect.  However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the \"Ringheads\" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works.

Tolkien novels was an intellectual rite of passage; whilst young, you read and enjoyed \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy willingly - prepping with \"The Hobbit\", of course. \"It's a job that's never started that takes the longest to finish,\" someone said. Writer/director Peter Jackson's \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" is the first of an extremely well-produced trilogy. Understandably, it's made into a special effects extravaganza, without taking many breaths for thoughtfulness.\"The Bridge of Khazad-Dûm\" (#30 on your DVD menu) sequence is a highlight; it climaxes with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the demonic Balrog (CGI) falling into an abyss, from which return seemed impossible This was one of my most memorable \"Lord of the Rings\" reading experiences - a future without Gandalf was unimaginable. Mr. Jackson and company recreate some emotional scenes extraordinarily well. At one time, it seemed impossible to think that such literature could be brought to cinematic form.******** The Fellowship of the Ring (12/10/01) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom",

        "text": "New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release.This fantasy film based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.Set in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is seeking the One Ring. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions who form the Fellowship of the Ring begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed.Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval \"Middle-earth\" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo is in fact the \"One Ring,\" a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn and Boromir; Elf archer Legolas; and Dwarf soldier Gimli. The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen, her father, Elrond, and Queen Galadriel. In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron. The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor.Peter Jackson has not only attempted the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he's pulled it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, too.Visually striking, thematically poignant, and morally weighty, the first film of Lord of the Rings is superb for it manages to thrill and enthrall despite its length and repetition.The production design is a marvel, and the special effects are dazzling but nevertheless,it manages to stay attuned to the story and the character.",

        "text": "Spoilers herein.For some reason, IMDB dropped my original comment. Only Gandolf knows why. This is a slim replacement, but done after some time has passed. That distance is valuable.The game here is one that you can only lose. Books can tap the imagination in ways that film ruins because what you see constrains what you can imagine. The books were successful because they created a whole world in such a way that found niches in our ability to envision. The best that can be done is to amaze visually, not trample the actual story, and hope that distracts from the fact that something unbounded is now visually bounded forever.My original comment spoke to small compromises made in the film that make the pagan notions fit more clearly in a Christian context. That's likely what prompted the removing complaint, so I avoid repeating the mistake. But I will note how the women, Ms Blanchett and Tyler are photographed. They are so idealized (even for film!) that I sat impressed. The camera can construct beauty and imply so much more. They do so here, and many girls will struggle with these ideals in the future.I think the idealization of Cate adds one dimension to the story that wasn't quite in the book: Cate's magical pledge could be seen as creating a vision that is the entire rest of the story. I prefer this, seeing all the monsters and motivations as coming from this lovely magical queen's mind. Cate as Elizabeth, the magical queen that Spencer has as the Fairie Queen whose dreams define the world. This way, the imagination part of the project is made explicit.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

        "text": "I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming \" This is our film \" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying \" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby \" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding \" No \" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS",

        "text": "THE LORD OF THE RINGS has its admirers who are familiar with the plot and the strange characters inhabiting it--and who genuinely love the book and were eager to see their favorite story on the big screen.In this case, it helps if you are familiar with the plot and the characters because the screenplay is a murky one with none of the characters given enough time for us to understand what they are all about. Instead, we move from set piece to set piece (grand, beautiful sets abetted by dazzling visual effects) and in between each new grand view locale there's another battle of good vs. evil with weapons clashing in every direction and limbs lopped off as fierce battles ensue.It's a sort of dungeons and dragons world and if this is your thing then this is your dark movie adventure. I saw this on video rather than the big screen so I can assure you it probably all looks a lot grander on the theater screen with the deafening stereo sound effects adding to the vigor of the story. But none of the characters really stand out amid all this swordplay and skullduggery.Only Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood have substantial enough parts to connect a viewer to the movie. The others are all backgrounders without becoming characters we care about--with the exception, perhaps, of Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, who always makes a convincing villain. Another problem is the sound--voices are dropped so often that much of the stilted dialogue is muted. This is a special drawback because several of the actors have some sort of accent. The worst offender happens to be Ian McKellen who nevertheless gives a very compelling performance behind his grizzly make-up--however, someone should have dubbed some of his lines for greater clarity. The likeable Elijah Wood relies on his specialty--wide-eyed wonder or tense concern for close-ups, but it's rather a one-note performance.All in all, I was disappointed. With all of the hype (and due to some of the comments expressed here) I expected a much more substantial story than this, especially for a movie with a running time of almost three hours. The drawback on video is that many of the special effects are pretty obvious and the big screen grandeur is lost even when viewed on a large TV screen.\nA bit of a letdown in every department. Even the score only occasionally has the right mystical quality between battles. The battles are not quite as brutal as those in GLADIATOR but their intensity is just as great and they turn up with alarming frequency!",

All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it's the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!",

Never has a fantasy world looked so realistic as in Lord of the Rings. All the sets are very detailed and have a realistic feeling as well as the characters and the different races of Middle Earth.The greatest strength of this movie is not the story itself. The story itself is actually pretty simple, basically it's just about the Ring and the quest to destroy it. No, the greatest strength are the characters, the look of Middle Earth and the action sequences. Rarely has an adventure movie looked so good and has been so tense and enjoyable to watch.But let's not over praise it, the movie has it flaws and weak spots. There are some unnecessary and boring scene's (especially in the Extended Edition) but for an 3 hour + movie that's maybe just unavoidable. And no matter how awesome everything looks, the special effects aren't always top-class, I'm a firm believer that the movie would have been better if ILM provided the special effects. But let's not judge the movie for what it could have been but let's judge it for what it is. Also, sometimes the Hobbits (Sam, Pippin and Merry) are border line irritating. Another thing that disturbed me was the editing, in my opinion it was extremely bad done in some of the scene's (For instance in the wizards battle between Gandalf and Saruman) but having some editing experience myself I might pay extra attention to this things...But in this case all those flaws and weak spots are forgiven, for The Fellowship of the Ring truly is a wonderful movie that you simply must have seen at least once in your life.Already a classic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Prior to my viewing of this, I didn't care for Jackson, although The Frighteners had its moments. I put off watching this until tonight, where it was on TV. In other words, I cannot judge this as an adaptation, nor can I comment on the Extended Edition. What I can say is that this gripped me from the first frame and did not let go until the last one. That ought to give you an idea of how well-crafted and brilliantly executed a cinematic achievement it is. The plot is compelling and well-told. In spite of a large group of characters, this keeps track of, and develops, them all quite nicely. The acting is spot-on. I did find the comic relief to be annoying, but there's immensely little of it if you look at the overall running time, that aspect of it wasn't made for me(I can imagine kids enjoy it, and it's harmless and inoffensive), and it's easy enough to look past. This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant. There is nothing really offensive in this, though children might find the battle sequences too intense. I recommend this to everyone who can see themselves getting into this. 10/10",

For instance, the set-piece battle with the Balrog ran to two pages, the Tom Bombadil episode, during which practically nothing nothing of any consequence happened, ran to more than 20! I was always one for story more than texture, as a result of which I began to feel that Tolkien had been in desperate need of an editor who would have helped him strip a flabby 1,100 page book down to a pacey, punchy 500 or so (I'm not keen on reading poems in Elvish, but I appreciate that this is my point of view, not necessarily others').So I went to see part 1 of Jackson's epic adaptation with enthusiasm and trepidation in equal measure.I heartily endorse every editorial decision made by Jackson. Tom Bombadil - gone! As a result, despite 3 hours of running time, part 1 never flags. The story moves constantly with plenty (but not too much) of character set up, back story, and narrative drive.Part 1 deals with the history of the Ring and the beginning of Frodo's journey, to Rivendell in the company of his follow Hobbit and then Aragorn, then through the mines of Moria with the Fellowship, and finally from Lothlorien up to the point where the Fellowship is split apart by an orc attack and Boromir dies.The casting is just absolutely right - every part is perfectly cast. New Zealand, as assisted by CGI tweaks, is Middle Earth. And the pace of the film is also perfect, alternating between excitement, humour, edge of your seat suspense, and interest-filled exposition.Brilliant.",

The plot regards a ring severed off the finger of a demonic figure and the quest to destroy it. Despite its glorious production values and a detailed screenplay it is still hinder when arriving at a sudden cliff-hanger ending. Director Peter Jackson captures the spirit of the material with extraordinary visual effects. Ian McKellen delivers a compelling performance as Gandalf the wizard out to guide Hoblit Frodo in his quest to destroy the ring. Gandalf is imprisoned by a demonic adversary but escapes. As Frodo Elijah Wood is to put the ring on in the midst of danger because it renders him invisible. He received the ring as a gift before being warned of its power. From there he is sent on a quest to destroy the ring while avoiding its magical temptations. Viggo Mortensen as future King Aragon is a warrior who accompanies the Hobbits to a violent standoff with ogres. Sean Astin plays Frodo's friend Sam who will be his strong right arm. Liv Tyler plays a princess and Aragon's romantic interest. In the end it is a triumphant visual effects that bring the book to life but it acts mainly as a fellowship in Hollywood overspending.

        "text": "RELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien's popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular 'Fellowship of the Ring,' to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. The rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond). This three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it'd be sinful to give it a lower rating. There are problems, however, at least for those who aren't uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could've been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn't care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant. Fifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren't much more than glorified cameos. \"Mythica: A Quest for Heroes\" (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. Despite these negatives, \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. GRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",

It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting, and good character development as well.  I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended.  I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick.  That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending, but I still give this movie a 10, because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it.  If you want to see a great movie, one that delivers where so many have promised, but failed to deliever then this is the film to see...even if you didn't read the book.

        "text": "and Harry Potter is the Wizard of Oz of my generation, then my generation is truly pathetic.Okay, it's not like FotR is a bad movie. In my opinion, the first two hours are flawed but very entertaining. It is the third hour where it gets really clunky, repetitive, and nonsensical. First off, I have not read the books. I claim that as an advantage, since I cannot criticize the filmmakers for skipping my favorite parts. No one else should be doing this either, but it is inevitable. But my first major criticism has to do with the novels. This film has the same setback that all fantasy novels do - too many characters. It works better in novels, to be sure, but it certainly is a disadvantage to a film. I knew only about three or four names among the main characters by the end. Also, character development is impossible here. I knew only two characters by the end of the movie: Gandolf and Bilbo. You wanna know why? Because the actors who played them, Ian McKellen and Ian Holm, are masters. Their characters are not developed in dialogue, but by acting. Elijah Wood is almost there. None of the others comes close, although Liv Tyler didn't seem too bad (her character was too small here to judge well). It's also true that none of the situations were at all well developed. The whole film feels rushed, which we might expect in a movie based on a long novel. That still isn't forgivable. A lot of references get thrown out in the air with little explanation, and I heard several groups of viewers talking amongst themselves to see what was going on.But that's not all. There's plenty to criticize elsewhere as well. The story itself is lame. Let me guess: another uber-evil villain wants to control the world. How uninteresting can you get? I guess these novels may have started that trend, although I doubt that. Still, it was lame when Tolkien invented it and it's still lame in fantasy novels today. Then there's the cinematography: it's repetitive. The novel's structure is basically one of an endless parade of locales, and the basic shot is an aerial view of the umpteen good guys walking in a straight line across whatever locale they've reached. Peter Jackson must have spent at least half of the 16 months it took to make these three films sitting in a helicopter! Also, the battle scenes are ridiculous. Anyone who complains when the rebels live in the battle scenes in Star Wars, or how the Storm Troopers always miss is going to laugh themselves silly when they see these nine fellows, four of whom barely fight (the hobbits), dispatch hundreds of drooling orcs in a matter of ten minutes. So what did I like? Well, some of the action sequences are awfully entertaining, despite their ludicrousness. I especially like the special effects of the troll, and his fight with the group. That was very exciting. To further criticize the poor structure, I felt that the Balrog sequence was quite boring after that. It looked far too much like the devil from Fantasia's Night on Bald Mountain number. The Balrog in the Ralph Bakshi cartoon looked much cooler, actually. The showdown between Balrog and Gandolf was rather lame considering. I also liked the lovingly created and detailed locales, except for the Shire, which is boring. But most of everything else was great. The Ring Wraiths were pretty cool. I especially liked the way everything looked when Frodo puts on the ring.\nOther than those scant things, this was a huge disappointment considering the recent imdb fiasco. This truly is a blight on our great site. Embarrassing to the highest degree. 6/10.",

This type of film is usually not my thing.  I was disappointed, not with the movie itself, or characters but the length.  Many scenes should never left the cutting room floor, and the ending leaves you hanging.  I wish they added more to the end, and some from the middle.

        "text": "I first saw this film when it came out in December 2001. At that time I had never read Tolkien's works and had little interest in the heroic fantasy genre either in literature or in the cinema, where I associated it with garbage along the lines of \"Conan the Barbarian\". I was, however, persuaded to see 'The Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from the critics. I went into the cinema expecting a twee tale of elves, gnomes and fairies but, despite my prejudices against fantasy, I quickly came to realise that Peter Jackson's film was a masterpiece.The plot of the film is too complex to be summarised here in any depth. At its centre is a magic ring (a motif Tolkien seems to have borrowed from Wagner and which symbolically represents the corrupting power of evil). This ring can give its owner immense power, but can only be used for evil purposes. At the beginning of the film the ring is owned by the elderly hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who acquired it many years before and has no idea of its power. He is warned by the wizard Gandalf that the evil Dark Lord Sauron, who originally forged the ring, is trying to regain it in order to enslave Middle-Earth (the imagined world in which the story is set). \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" relates how Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his companions- the \"Fellowship\"- set out on a journey to destroy the ring, something that can only be achieved by casting it into Mount Doom, the volcano in which it was originally forged.The film is beautifully shot against some stunning landscapes in Jackson's native New Zealand, and the action sequences, particularly the fight sequences, are brilliantly handled. Another important factor is Howard Shore's vivid and evocative musical score. The main reason for the film's success, however, is the acting. In most fantasy films this is regarded as being less important than special effects and a dramatic storyline, and in some such as \"Conan\" or \"Red Sonja\" the standards of acting are ludicrously low. Jackson avoids falling into this trap and brings out some great performances from his cast. There are too many for me to single them all out for mention. The best is from Ian McKellen as Gandalf, combining wisdom and authority with kindliness. The scene where he fights the Balrog in the Mines of Moria is probably the most heart-stopping in the film. Elijah Wood as Frodo, with his fragile, epicene looks succeeds in capturing his character's courage and determination, as well as hinting at his physical and emotional weaknesses. I also liked Christopher Lee as Saruman, a former colleague of Gandalf who is tempted by cowardice and self-interest to ally himself with the powers of evil, and the generally excellent Sean Bean as the tragic figure of Boromir, who is destroyed by his obsession with using the ring against Sauron himself, a course which his companions reject because they fear being corrupted by the ring's power.I recently watched the film for the second time, having in the interim seen the second and third episodes and been inspired by them to read the original novel. There has been some criticism of Jackson for omitting some parts of the book, such as the Tom Bombadil episode in Part I and the Scouring of the Shire in Part III. In my view, however, his approach was the right one. Although these episodes are important parts of the book, there are major differences between the cinematic and the literary approaches to story-telling. A novel can be more discursive; a film needs to tell the story in a more direct manner, and Jackson was right to omit those episodes which do not serve to advance the main story-line.There is little point in trying to decide which of the three parts is the best, because Jackson's work can be regarded as a single ten-hour film rather than as series of three, albeit a film that was released in three parts for commercial reasons. Tolkien similarly regarded \"The Lord of the Rings\" as a single novel rather than as a trilogy, but it was published in three parts because the publishers felt that the public would balk at a novel of 1,500 pages. My mark reflects my view of the three parts as a whole. 10/10.",

        "text": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is adventure and fantasy filmmaking at its finest, and I see no reason why fans of the novel and the series all together would not find it commendable or laudable. It exceeded my personal expectations, and I have never read J. R. R. Tolkien's acclaimed trilogy, nor did I possess any prior knowledge of the stories ahead of time. The experience was open for many surprises, and boy did it bring some.The story, which I will do my best to explain, is set in Middle Earth, sixty years after the Dark Lord Sauron tried to conquer it by using the One Ring, which rules and binds the people together. At the time of the attempt to conquer the land, the ring was left in possession of Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who has now passed it on to his nephew, Frodo (Wood). Wizard Gandalf the Grey (McKellen) informs Frodo of Sauron's powerful forces and sends him and his friend Samwise (Astin) out of town so they can destroy the ring and prevent any abuse of power. Along the way, they pick up numerous friends and acquaintances, and together, they are off to destroy the ring. The wonderful ring of...Middle Earth.It may come as a surprise to some people that this is actually the third attempt to bring J. R. R. Tolkien's book to film. The first attempt was done in 1978 by Ralph Bakshi, while the second was a Television film called The Return of the King in 1980. It almost seemed The Lord of the Rings series was plagued of having inferior, slightly incompetent films and was unable to adapt to the big screen, until Peter Jackson blew everyone, including the Oscars, away with his star-studded, beautifully made adaptation of one of the world's most beloved series.Yes, The Lord of the Rings is a beauty. Mainly in its art direction, which is heavily detailed and breathtaking in appearance. Special effects run rampant in Jackson's film, and they are used as an enhancement tool rather than as a simple distraction. This wasn't long after The Matrix was released, so having the audience treated to a world-wind of special effects still wasn't very common in films. I have been told from many fans of Tolkien's work was that what made the novels work so well was (a) they were long and unexpected, almost seeming as if anything could happen, always leaving the reader in some essence of suspense and involvement and (b) were extremely vibrant, detailed, and descriptive. Atmospheres were always described intricately, suspense and peril were captured with a great sense of urgency and delight, and the characters were sweet, charming, and very, very developed.If I had to knock the epic for being one thing, it's that it seems from all the things I have read and been told about the novel, it's as if the film focuses a bit too much on action and swordplay. Still, there's enough buildup and dialog to keep one interested. The film may have a simple plot, but it evokes it as if it was a complex, never-ending journey through the sands of time.The performances are to die for. Sean Astin, a very underrated talent whom we saw in Encino Man and The Goonies, is all grown up and spunky here as Sam, the wisecracking admirable Hobbit, and Elijah Wood is capable and simply mesmerizing as Frodo. But the grand performance of the epic easily goes to Ian McKellen as the always intriguing and slightly ominous Wizard Gandalf. McKellen plays a wizard how I believe a real one would act. Witty, a tad clumsy, but very insightful and enriching every time he speaks, as well as providing much needed reassurance and optimism. It can be considered an unforgivable crime not to have awarded him the Best Supporting Actor award.And now, for the question of the hour; will I pursue the other two films? As of now, I don't plan on it. The Fellowship of the Ring was a marvelous excursion, but a protracted and extensive one, sometimes providing boredom. Fantasy has never been my cup of tea, as I have always preferred my films with a sense of realism, comedy, suspense, and characters. There are people who take the genre seriously and I can't blame them. We must treasure works of mythical art in the time of depressing and oppressive circumstances, and to the ones who get very involved with a franchise or series, I admire and envy you. It was just never my thing.But who knows? Perhaps one day I will complete the odyssey that is The Lord of the Rings. I told myself going in that this film had to be very, very immersing and reach untold levels of excitement and involvement for me to move on to two other films totaling in over six hours. It was very good, but not good enough for me to invest one fourth of a day in the rest of the material.Starring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, and Ian Holm.

        "text": "I can remember back over twenty years ago when I first saw a Peter Jackson movie. It was his splatter comedy Bad Taste. Not long after that I saw his anti-Muppets film Meet The Feebles which funnily enough was in even worse taste. And that was followed by his bigger budgeted but insanely gory horror-comedy Brain Dead. Now, if someone had said to me right then that Jackson would be given the task of helming one of the most prestigious, expensive and elaborate film franchises ever less than a decade later I would have asked them if they'd taken their daily medication. It was surely on the basis of his later – and still best - film Heavenly Creatures that Jackson must surely have got the gig. That one incorporated some nice fantasy visuals into its story. But even taking that into account it's still a surprise he got to direct Lord of the Rings. But it's a good thing that he did because clearly this is a film made with an extreme level of loving care and Jackson seems to have more or less pleased the rabid fans of the books. Which is pretty remarkable all things considered.I still haven't seen the third part of the trilogy which is clearly something I have to get around to doing soon but I get the distinct impression that this first part is the one I am ultimately going to favour the most. Whereas The Two Towers has that tricky middle part syndrome, it also is as much about an epic battle scene as anything else, in The Fellowship of the Ring clearly the recreation and exploration of Middle-Earth is the main selling point. And I suppose this is the key to this opening act being so decent. The detailed artistic recreations of The Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lothlorien and Mordor are remarkably well done. They offer a great contrast of fantasy visuals and complaining about them just seems a bit churlish. On top of that, we are introduced to a very good ensemble cast. Every actor is chosen well for the role. Possibly with the exception of Legolas (a bit bland) and Gimli - or MacGimli as I like to call him on account of his ludicrous Scottish accent – who I simply found rather amazingly annoying. But this is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things. Overall, this is a pretty fine cinematic rendering of Tolkien's fantasy world.",

This has got to be one of the best trilogy I have ever seen. Peter Jackson did a amazing job with the adaptation from a classic book to the big screen. I don't see how anyone else would have directed this movie any better. This movie is just beautiful plain and simple, from the gorgeous landscape to the vivid and fantasy like atmosphere. I have just never seen a movie like this before and seeing in theaters when it first came out was a amazing experience. If you like movies this is a movie that most definitely shouldn't be missed. But I highly recommend anyone that watches this movie to see the extended edition most definitely. It has important bits that was missing from when it was released in theaters. Which is mostly the fellowship and bonding aspect of it all and these are really important fellowship scenes. It literally helps in understanding the characters a lot better and why the characters are the way they are. And it will help understand the future installments a lot better as well. Anyways I highly recommend anyone that want to experience this epic and amazing journey to watch the extended edition, it really does add a lot to the film. The movie is more than just about a group of warriors and villagers such as humans, hobbits, elves and dwarfs getting together to fight there way to destroy a ring of power that was created by an evil villain Sauron. Although that is the main plot there is just way more to this movie and has important messages. This story is just simply well crafted into a movie and has epic written all over it. The actors that played each character is just perfect for there role and I just couldn't think of anyone better to play those roles, the casting for this movie was just perfect. Yes, some of the main characters aren't entirely fleshed out but they all stand out in this movie and the story itself will keep the audiences occupied since it's simply engrossing. Plus they are all mostly likable and you care for these characters because they are strong characters and not just physically either. This movie is simply nothing short of a masterpiece. Yes, I know some parts were cut from the book and some scenes weren't even in the book but those added scenes was a cool idea and added many positive aspects to this film than it being negative. Those scenes are very well integrated into this epic film. Jackson and his crew achieved making a movie of this magnitude that most people thought was impossible and he did it for the two other movies in this trilogy as well. The special effects, the props they used and the set pieces are just wonderfully crafted and it really does bring Middle-earth to life. This movie is ahead of it's time although it wasn't released all that long ago and is a masterpiece of a film that should not be missed. Some of the Biblical elements was interesting to watch as well.9.3/10",

Still, there's a lot to like and the most memorable moments are the most kinetic ones, when our fellowship is on their journey and besieged by the dark forces of their unseen enemy. These are filmed with an undeniable spirit and rag-tag inventiveness (amplified to fit its budget), both evident by the plethora of brilliant behind-the-scenes footage available on the blu-ray, that penetrate even the most unnecessary - and, by extension, dullest - of segments. It is a bizarre beast for sure, at one time my favourite of the three for its sheer amount of 'story' but now sitting somewhere in the middle because that 'story' is mostly just 'stuff'. Each time I watch it, I have a slightly different reaction. Nevertheless, I'm entertained for most of its massive run-time and the fact it can provoke a reaction each time says something in itself, I think. When it moves, it really moves and the most memorable of scenes have stood the test of time almost like no others. When all the exposition falls away and Gandalf faces off against the Balrog, the Hobbits try to outrun the Nazgul or, most powerfully, Boromir takes a stand to save his two new friends, it's a great time. 8/10",
